\subsection{Air humidity}
Water vapour plays a crucial role in atmospheric heat transport and animal heat regulation. 

When water is evaporated latent heat is removed from the enviroment cooling it down. 
The vapor is transported by air movement releasing the energy as enthalpy of condensation when the water vapor has cooled down enough to condesate. %TODO source 
Moist air is less dense then dry air creating updraft, removing the energy from the urban canopey layer. 

In (homothermic) animals the body uses up energy for temperature regulation, making up a significant portion of burned calories. 
%In cold surroundings, muscle movement create heat energy warming the body. 
In hot surroundings, sweat or saliver is eradiated to cool the body by evaporation and blood moved towards the skin to radiate away heat to prevent hyperthermia. 
The higher the air humidity and therfore the lower the capacity to take up water vapour of the sourrounding air is, the lower the efficiency of sweating as a mechanism to regulate body heat works.
