%\glspl{UHI} pose a growing health risk by exacerbating heat stress for residents of urban areas.
%With the increased prevalence of extreme weather events, urbanization, and heat waves, and as a factor in higher energy consumption, \glspl{UHI} are becoming more relevant for city planners and policymakers.
%This work investigates the impact and influence of rising temperatures and land use change in cities on the severity of the \glspl{UHI}.
%Thermal Infrared Satellite Data is used to measure \glspl{SUHI} effects with machine learning algorithms for creating time series of land use and land cover (LULC) in selected cities, longitudinal measurement of UHI intensity, and the future modelling of \glspl{UHI} based on these findings.
%Additionally, various indices are employed to measure heat stress and other parameters related to UHI intensity.
%This comprehensive approach aims to provide a data-backed toolkit to aid urban planning and decision-making in mitigating UHI effects.
%The results of this study (TODO: ADD RESULTS) will offer insights into the direct and indirect impacts of urbanization and climatic changes on UHI phenomena.

\glspl{UHI} pose a growing health risk by exacerbating heat stress for residents of urban areas. 
Due to the increased prevalence of extreme weather events, urbanization and heat waves and as a cause for higher energy consumption, \glspl{UHI} become more relevant as a topic for city planners and policy makers to consider.
Identification of areas most impacted or at risk require a data backed tool set to aid urban planning. 
This work investigates the impact and influence of rising temperatures and land use change in cities on the severity of the \glspl{UHI} within them.
