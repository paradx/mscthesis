\glspl{UHI} pose a growing health risk by exacerbating heat stress for residents of urban areas. 
Due to the increased prevalence of extreme weather events, urbanization and heat waves and as a cause for higher energy consumption, \glspl{UHI} become more relevant as a topic for city planners and policy makers to consider.
Identification of areas most impacted or at risk require a data backed tool set to aid urban planning. 
This work investigates the impact and influence of rising temperatures and land use change in cities on the severity of the \glspl{UHI} within them.
