 
\subsection{Outlook and Future Work}
The classification part should be improved by using a widely available product that has a suitable resolution. 
During development the 300 m reference product~\cite{sec:references} was used but was not considered precise enough for these measurements.


One interesting area of study would be the Leipzig 416 Project, an urban district development project, currently being constructed in the city centre of Leipzig, designed to be environmentally friendly, vegetation rich and designed after sponge city concepts.
Monitoring the development of \glspl{UHI} in the area and surrounding could show how effective modern build style is compared to the previous situation.\\

Another interesting non-urban area of study could be large construction projects in previously rural areas, like the Tesla Factory in Gr√ºnheide, the Berlin Brandenburg Airport in Germany, the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) near Marseilles in France and the impact on the surrounding micro climate and fauna caused by the \gls{LULC} change.
