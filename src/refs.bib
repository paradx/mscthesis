The heat island grew most rapidly following sunset because of much stronger rural cooling. The maximum heat island occurred 3–5 h after sunset in both cities, and in both summer and winter. Rural cooling followed Brunt's formula, but the urban area showed a linear drop in temperature with time. Hence it was possible to assign a rural thermal admittance, but not an urban one.

However, observations of air temperature are typically only available from a limited number of weather stations distributed mainly in developed countries, which in turn may often report time series with missing values. As a consequence, the record of air temperature observations is patchy in both space and time. Satellites, on the other hand, measure land surface temperature continuously in both space and time. In order to combine the relative strengths of surface and satellite temperature records, we develop a dataset in which monthly air temperature is predicted from monthly land surface temperature for the years 2003 to 2016, using a statistical model that incorporates information on geographic and climatic similarity. We expect this dataset to be useful for various applications involving climate monitoring and land-climate interactions.},

This system is forced by meteorological conditions based on present-climate reanalyses (1970–2007), and climate projections (2071–2099) provided by global climate model simulations following two emission scenarios (A1B and A2). This study aims at quantifying the impact of climate change on air temperature within the city and in the surroundings. A systematic increase of 2-meter air temperature is found. In average according to the two scenarios, it reaches + 2.0/2.4°C in winter and + 3.5/5.0°C in summer for the minimum and maximum daily temperatures, respectively. During summer, the warming trend is more pronounced in the surrounding countryside than in Paris and suburbs due to the soil dryness. As a result, a substantial decrease of the strong urban heat islands is noted at nighttime, and numerous events with negative urban heat islands appear at daytime. Finally, a 30\% decrease of the heating degree days is quantified in winter between present and future climates. Inversely, the summertime cooling degree days significantly increase in future climate whereas they are negligible in present climate. However, in terms of accumulated degree days, the increase of the demand in cooling remains smaller than the decrease of the demand in heating.},

The existing procedures are subdivided into three main categories: Thermal indices, Empirical indices and indices based on Linear Equations; for each approach, case studies are presented and subdivided according to Koeppen Climatic Classification (Polar, Cold, Temperate, Arid and Tropical). International regulations and software available to quantify outdoor human comfort and microclimate are presented, as well as a graphic thermal scale to compare the ability of each procedure to respond to the 11-point thermal sensation scale (from Sweltering to Extremely Cold). Finally, the models are presented as function of their ability to analyse climate, microclimate and human-related characteristics of the selected built environment. This paper aims at bringing a comprehensive introduction to the topic of the outdoor human comfort, helping the reader to understand the existing procedures and guiding the choice of the suitable options according to specific research needs.},

There are 46 UHI risk indicators linked to three pillars of sustainability: social equity, economic viability, and environmental protection. In this study, the UHI risk indicators were first validated by experts to determine their relevancy and subsequently applied to randomly sampled dwellers of Thailand’s capital Bangkok. The UHI indicators were further validated with confirmatory factor analysis to determine the factor loadings (0–1) and reliability. Under the hazard component, the percentage of days when the daily minimum temperature is less than the 10th percentile exhibited the highest indicator-level factor loading (0.915). Vehicular traffic was the UHI exposure indicator with the highest factor loading (0.923), and the proportion of green space to build environment was the UHI sensitivity indicator with the highest factor loading (0.910). For the UHI adaptive capacity component, the highest factor loading (0.910) belonged to government policy and action. To effectively mitigate UHI impacts, greater emphasis should be placed on the indicators with highest factor loadings. Essentially, this research is the first to use statistical structural equation modeling to validate UHI indicators.},

  abstract   = {Industrial production activities are an important source of urban heat emissions. Quantifying the contribution of industrial zones to urban heat islands (UHIs) is crucial for urban planning and management. However, few studies have explored the quantitative relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and urban industrial zones (UIZs) at the urban scale, especially the direct impact of industrial expansion or contraction on LST. Linyi City, the largest city in Shandong Province, was selected as the study area. This study aims to analyze the spatial-temporal variation in the UIZs in Linyi City from 2013 to 2022, focusing on the quantitative relationship between LST and UIZs. Using remote sensing images, a novel spectral index (called the BCCSI) was constructed to identify factory buildings. The performance of the BCCSI was validated using five existing indices and Google Earth images. Over the past 10 years, the UIZ area of Linyi has increased by 137.16 km2. The UIZs in Linyi are mainly distributed in counties near the urban center, and counties with large UIZ areas are also hotspots for UIZ changes. Moreover, we found that the contraction or expansion of UIZs has obvious effects on LST. After the contraction (or expansion) of UIZs, the LST decreased (or increased) by 0.48 °C (0.39 °C). In addition, we found that there is an exponential relationship between LST and the industrial unit area (P value less than 0.01). This research is valuable for environmental assessment and fine management of industrial cities.},

  abstract  = {In recent decades, Urban Heat Island Effects have become more pronounced and more widely examined. Despite great technological advances, our current societies still experience great spatial disparity in urban forest access. Urban Heat Island Effects are measurable phenomenon that are being experienced by the world’s most urbanized areas, including increased summer high temperatures and lower evapotranspiration from having impervious surfaces instead of vegetation and trees. Tree canopy cover is our natural mitigation tool that absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis, protects humans from incoming radiation, and releases cooling moisture into the air. Unfortunately, urban areas typically have low levels of vegetation. Vulnerable urban communities are lower-income areas of inner cities with less access to heat protection like air conditioners. This study uses mean evapotranspiration levels to assess the variability of urban heat island effects across the state of Tennessee. Results show that increased developed land surface cover in Tennessee creates measurable changes in atmospheric evapotranspiration. As a result, the mean evapotranspiration levels in areas with less tree vegetation are significantly lower than the surrounding forested areas. Central areas of urban cities in Tennessee had lower mean evapotranspiration recordings than surrounding areas with less development. This work demonstrates the need for increased tree canopy coverage.},

  abstract = {Cooling down the surface temperature of buildings and saving energy consumption are tasks of top priority in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The bright and colorful pearlescent pigmented cool coatings with high near-infrared (NIR) reflectance possess promise in enhancing the reflective effect of solar light and the visual aspect, which is still an undeveloped domain. Herein, these novel solar reflective coatings containing mediums and pearlescent pigments with high NIR reflectance of 85\% embodied obvious energy-saving effects on building materials. EnergyPlus software was used to simulate the energy-saving effect of four applied climate zones, including New York, Nanchang, Lima, and Brasilia. Compared to commercial pigments (Fe2O3, γ-Ce2S3) with similar colors, the RK 402 and RK 301 pearlescent pigments demonstrate superior energy-saving capabilities in Nanchang climate zone, and can save 1.00 kW h m−2 and 1.60 kW h m−2 annually, respectively. In the warmer climate zone of Brasilia, the highest energy-saving efficiency is 2.06 kW h m−2 over one year by RK 301 pearlescent pigment. After irradiated by an NIR lamp, the surface temperature of the RK 301 coating can be reduced by 34.8 °C compared with that of the Fe2O3 commercial coating, and that of RK 402 coating is 5.2 °C compared with the γ-Ce2S3 commercial coating. Furthermore, the 7-day field test also has consistent effect of cooling down the surface temperature. This work demonstrated that pearlescent coatings with brilliant colors have great potential for application as cold materials in building areas to mitigate the UHI effect.},

Accurate assessments of population heat exposure hinge on the interplay between temperature, population spatial dynamics, and the epidemiological effects of temperature on health. Yet, many past studies have over-simplified the matter by assuming static populations, leading to substantial inaccuracies in heat exposure assessments. To address these issues, this study integrates dynamic population data, fluctuating temperature, and the exposure-response relationship between temperature and health to construct an advanced heat exposure assessment framework predicated on a population dynamic model. We analyzed urban heat island characteristics, population dynamics, and heat exposure during heat wave conditions in Beijing, a major city in China. Our findings highlight significant intra-day population movement between urban and suburban areas during heat wave conditions, with spatial population flow patterns showing clear scale-dependent characteristics. These population flow dynamics intensify heat exposure levels, and the disparity between dynamic population-weighted temperature and average temperature is most pronounced at night. Our research provides a more comprehensive understanding of real urban population heat exposure levels and can furnish city administrators with more scientifically rigorous evidence.},

  abstract = {In the modern era of urban climatology, much emphasis has been placed on observing and documenting
heat island magnitudes in cities around the world. Urban climate literature consequently boasts a remarkable accumulation
of observational heat island studies. Through time, however, methodologists have raised concerns about the authenticity
of these studies, especially regarding the measurement, definition and reporting of heat island magnitudes. This paper
substantiates these concerns through a systematic review and scientific critique of heat island literature from the period
1950–2007. The review uses nine criteria of experimental design and communication to critically assess methodological
quality in a sample of 190 heat island studies. Results of this assessment are discouraging: the mean quality score of
the sample is just 50 percent, and nearly half of all urban heat island magnitudes reported in the sample are judged
to be scientifically indefensible. Two areas of universal weakness in the literature sample are controlled measurement
and openness of method : one-half of the sample studies fail to sufficiently control the confounding effects of weather,
relief or time on reported ‘urban’ heat island magnitudes, and three-quarters fail to communicate basic metadata
regarding instrumentation and field site characteristics. A large proportion of observational heat island literature is
therefore compromised by poor scientific practice. This paper concludes with recommendations for improving method
and communication in heat island studies through better scrutiny of findings and more rigorous reporting of primary
research. Copyright  2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

The maximum heat island occurred 3-5 h after sunset in both cities, and in both summer and 
winter. Rural cooling followed Brunt’s formula, but the urban area showed a linear drop in tem-

  abstract   = {Retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from satellite data allows to estimate the
surface urban heat island (SUHI) as the difference between the LST obtained in the urban area
and the LST of its surroundings. However, this definition depends on the selection of the urban
and surroundings references, which translates into greater difficulty in comparing SUHI values in
different urban agglomerations across the world. In order to avoid this problem, a methodology is
proposed that allows reliable quantification of the SUHI. The urban reference is obtained from the
European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover and three surroundings references
are considered; that is, the urban adjacent (Su), the future adjacent (Sf), and the peri-urban (Sp),
which are obtained from mathematical expressions that depend exclusively on the urban area.
In addition, two formulations of SUHI are considered: SUHIMAX and SUHIMEAN, which evaluate
the maximum and average SUHI of the urban area for each of the three surrounding references.
As the urban population growth phenomenon is a world-scale problem, this methodology has been
applied to 71 urban agglomerations around the world using LST data obtained from the sea and
land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) on board Sentinel-3A. The results show average values
of SUHIMEAN of (1.8 ± 0.9) ◦C, (2.6 ± 1.3) ◦C, and (3.1 ± 1.7) ◦C for Su, Sf, and Sp, respectively,
and an average difference between SUHIMAX and SUHIMEAN of (3.1 ± 1.1) ◦C. To complete the study,
two additional indices have been considered: the Urban Thermal Field Variation Index (UFTVI) and
the Discomfort Index (DI), which proved to be essential for understanding the SUHI phenomenon
and its consequences on the quality of life of the inhabitants.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, Urban Heat Island Effects have become more pronounced and more widely examined. Despite great technological advances, our current societies still experience great spatial disparity in urban forest access. Urban Heat Island Effects are measurable phenomenon that are being experienced by the world’s most urbanized areas, including increased summer high temperatures and lower evapotranspiration from having impervious surfaces instead of vegetation and trees. Tree canopy cover is our natural mitigation tool that absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis, protects humans from incoming radiation, and releases cooling moisture into the air. Unfortunately, urban areas typically have low levels of vegetation. Vulnerable urban communities are lower-income areas of inner cities with less access to heat protection like air conditioners. This study uses mean evapotranspiration levels to assess the variability of urban heat island effects across the state of Tennessee. Results show that increased developed land surface cover in Tennessee creates measurable changes in atmospheric evapotranspiration. As a result, the mean evapotranspiration levels in areas with less tree vegetation are significantly lower than the surrounding forested areas. Central areas of urban cities in Tennessee had lower mean evapotranspiration recordings than surrounding areas with less development. This work demonstrates the need for increased tree canopy coverage.},

  abstract  = {Kernel methods have long been established as effective techniques in the framework of machine learning and pattern recognition, and have now become the standard approach to many remote sensing applications. With algorithms that combine statistics and geometry, kernel methods have proven successful across many different domains related to the analysis of images of the Earth acquired from airborne and satellite sensors, including natural resource control, detection and monitoring of anthropic infrastructures (e.g. urban areas), agriculture inventorying, disaster prevention and damage assessment, and anomaly and target detection.   Presenting the theoretical foundations of kernel methods (KMs) relevant to the remote sensing domain, this book serves as a practical guide to the design and implementation of these methods. Five distinct parts present state-of-the-art research related to remote sensing based on the recent advances in kernel methods, analysing the related methodological and practical challenges:  Part I introduces the key concepts of machine learning for remote sensing, and the theoretical and practical foundations of kernel methods. Part II explores supervised image classification including Super Vector Machines (SVMs), kernel discriminant analysis, multi-temporal image classification, target detection with kernels, and Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) algorithms for anomaly detection. Part III looks at semi-supervised classification with transductive SVM approaches for hyperspectral image classification and kernel mean data classification. Part IV examines regression and model inversion, including the concept of a kernel unmixing algorithm for hyperspectral imagery, the theory and methods for quantitative remote sensing inverse problems with kernel-based equations, kernel-based BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function), and temperature retrieval KMs.  Part V deals with kernel-based feature extraction and provides a review of the principles of several multivariate analysis methods and their kernel extensions.  This book is aimed at engineers, scientists and researchers involved in remote sensing data processing, and also those working within machine learning and pattern recognition.},

Later, 8,047 subjects reenrolled in 2002 (SAPALDIA 2). The effects of individually assigned traffic exposures on reported respiratory symptoms were estimated, while controlling for socioeconomic and exposure- and health-related factors. The risk of attacks of breathlessness increased for all subjects by 13\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 3, 24) per 500-m increment in the length of main street segments within 200 m of the home and decreased in never smokers by 12\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 0, 22) per 100-m increment in distance from home to a main street. Living within 20 m of a main street increased the risks of regular phlegm by 15\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 0, 31) and wheezing with breathing problems by 34\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 0, 79) in never smokers. In 2002, the effects related to road distance were different from those in 1991, which could be due to changes in the traffic pollution mixture. These findings among a general population provide strong confirmation that living near busy streets leads to adverse respiratory health effects.}},

  abstract   = {NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was designed to support the quantification and monitoring of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Its Snapshot Area Map (SAM) and target mode measurements provide an innovative dataset for carbon studies on sub-city scales. Unlike any other current space-based instrument, OCO-3 has the ability to scan large contiguous areas of emission hot spots like cities, power plants, and volcanoes. These measurements result in dense, fine-scale spatial maps of column averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2). For the first time, we present and analyze XCO2 distributions over the Los Angeles megacity (LA) derived from OCO-3 SAM and target mode observations. Urban XCO2 enhancements range from 0 − 6 ppm (median enhancements ≃ 2 ppm) relative to a clean background and show excellent agreement with nearby ground-based TCCON measurements of XCO2. OCO-3's dense observations reveal intra-urban variations of XCO2 over the city that have never been observed from space before. The spatial variations are mainly driven by the complex fossil fuel emission patterns and meteorological conditions in the LA Basin and are in good agreement with those from co-located TROPOMI measurements of co-emitted NO2. Differences between measured and simulated XCO2 enhancements from two models (WRF-Chem and X-STILT) are typically below 1 ppm with larger differences for some sub regions. Both models capture the observed intra-urban XCO2 gradients. Further, OCO-3's multi-swath measurements capture about three times as much of the city emissions compared to single-swath overpasses. OCO-3's frequent target and SAM mode observations will pave the way to constrain urban emissions at finer, sub-city scales.},

  abstract = {A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can produce high-resolution two-dimensional images of mapped areas. The SAR comprises a pulsed transmitter, an antenna, and a phase-coherent receiver. The SAR is borne by a constant velocity vehicle such as an aircraft or satellite, with the antenna beam axis oriented obliquely to the velocity vector. The image plane is defined by the velocity vector and antenna beam axis. The image orthogonal coordinates are range and cross range (azimuth). The amplitude and phase of the received signals are collected for the duration of an integration time after which the signal is processed. High range resolution is achieved by the use of wide bandwidth transmitted pulses. High azimuth resolution is achieved by focusing, with a signal processing technique, an extremely long antenna that is synthesized from the coherent phase history. The pulse repetition frequency of the SAR is constrained within bounds established by the geometry and signal ambiguity limits. SAR operation requires relative motion between radar and target. Nominal velocity values are assumed for signal processing and measurable deviations are used for error compensation. Residual uncertainties and high-order derivatives of the velocity which are difficult to compensate may cause image smearing, defocusing, and increased image sidelobes. The SAR transforms the ocean surface into numerous small cells, each with dimensions of range and azimuth resolution. An image of a cell can be produced provided the radar cross section of the cell is sufficiently large and the cell phase history is deterministic. Ocean waves evidently move sufficiently uniformly to produce SAR images which correlate well with optical photographs and visual observations. The relationship between SAR images and oceanic physical features is not completely understood, and more analyses and investigations are desired.},

Urban areas are the most vulnerable, and specifically, the road infrastructure. The accumulation of large volumes of water and sediments on road-stream intersections gets severe consequences for the road drainage structures. This study integrates the spatial and temporal soil moisture properties into the research about flood prediction methods by a case study of two areas in Sweden, Västra Götaland and Värmland, which was affected by severe flooding in August 2014. Soil moisture data are derived from remote-sensing techniques, with a focus on the soil moisture-specific satellites ASCAT and SMOS. Furthermore, several physical catchments descriptors (PCDs) are analyzed and the result shows that larger slopes and drainage density, in general, mean a higher risk of flooding. The precipitation is the same; however, it can be concluded that more precipitation in most cases gives higher soil moisture values. The lack, or the dimensioning, of road drainage structures seems to have a large impact on the flood risk as more sediment and water can be accumulated at the road-stream intersection. The results show that the method implementing soil moisture satellite data is promising for improving the reliability of flooding.},

  abstract  = {Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface temperature (LST)–vegetation relationship. This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, USA, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thermal, and moisture properties of the Earth's surface that determine LST.},

In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Köppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a more salutogenic urban design.},

Since urban residents and infrastructure are known to be highly vulnerable to extreme heat, the goal of this paper is to understand the interaction between the synoptic-scale heat wave and the city-scale urban heat island (UHI) effects. The study also qualitatively analyzes the primary factors that contribute to UHIs by comparing their intensities in different cities with distinct geo-physical characteristics. Our results, generated by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model augmented with advanced urban surface parameterizations, confirm that the amplitude of UHI is related to the physical size of the city. However, the results suggest that cities of comparabale sizes might interact differently with heat waves: in New York City; Washington, DC; and Baltimore (but not in Philadelphia) the regular UHI was amplified more strongly during heat waves compared to smaller cities. The results also establish that the pattern of UHI in different cities, its variability, and its interaction with heat waves are inherently linked to dynamic factors.},

This study focuses on understanding the influence of this subfacet heterogeneity, and the associated influence of different material properties, on the urban surface energy budget. The Princeton Urban Canopy Model, which was developed with the ability to capture subfacet variability, is evaluated at sites of various building densities and then applied to simulate the energy exchanges of each subfacet with the atmosphere over a densely built site. The analyses show that, although all impervious built surfaces convert most of the incoming energy into sensible heat rather than latent heat, sensible heat fluxes from asphalt pavements and dark rooftops are 2 times as high as those from concrete surfaces and light-colored roofs. Another important characteristic of urban areas—the shift in the peak time of sensible heat flux in comparison with rural areas—is here shown to be mainly linked to concrete’s high heat storage capacity as well as to radiative trapping in the urban canyon. The results also illustrate that the vegetated pervious soil surfaces that dot the urban landscape play a dual role: during wet periods they redistribute much of the available energy into evaporative fluxes but when moisture stressed they behave more like an impervious surface. This role reversal, along with the direct evaporation of water stored over impervious surfaces, significantly reduces the overall Bowen ratio of the urban site after rain events.},

  abstract  = {Nocturnal atmospheric cooling rates were investigated in a medium sized town in Sweden. Rates were found to be very different, depending on the time of the evening/night, therefore the urban heat island (UHI) development was divided into three phases: a, differential cooling; b, transition; and c, stabilization. In phase a the UHI intensity increases by differential cooling between urban and rural areas. In phase b, after the urban heat island circulation (UHIC) starts, there is a drastic change in the rural cooling rate. The urban cooling rate is unchanged in the early evening, but about 2 h after the start of the UHIC there is a sudden increase of the cooling rate as the cool rural air reaches the city centre. The UHIC is therefore assumed to be an effective way of transporting sensible heat between the rural and urban areas. In phase c this coupling results in an equalization of the cooling rates at both the rural and the urban site from 1.5 K h−1 and 1.0 K h−1, respectively, to 0.5 K h−1. Once the UHIC is activated, the system is self-regulating since if one factor is changed some of the others have to change as well in order to preserve the balance. In phase c the advective flux is estimated to be −9±4 W m−2 and to give a central UHI potential cooling of −0.3 K h−1 of the. Copyright  1999 Royal Meteorological Society},

A station located in Laverton (less urbanised area), which is 17 km southwest of Melbourne CBD, was selected as the reference station for the computation of UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD. Using daily minimum/maximum temperatures at the two stations, nocturnal/diurnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD were computed for the period 1952–2010. It was found that in Melbourne CBD, nocturnal UHI intensities show a clear rising trend over the period 1952–2010 unlike the diurnal UHI intensities. For the analysis of nocturnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD, under changing climate, for each calendar month statistical models based on the gene expression programming (GEP) technique were developed for downscaling general-circulation model (GCM) outputs to monthly average minimum temperature at Melbourne CBD and Laverton. Using the outputs of HadCM3, GFDL2.0 and ECHAM5 pertaining to the A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario on the downscaling models, projections of monthly average minimum temperature were produced for the two stations over the period 2000–2099. In each season, at both stations, the ensemble average of monthly minimum temperature gradually increased over the period 2000–2099. The ensemble-average UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD projected into the future was higher for all seasons in comparison to that of period 1952–1971. Downscaling models based on the GEP technique were developed for each calendar month for projecting the number of very hot days in November–March and very cold days in May–September in Melbourne CBD. It was found that, in the future, summer weather will spread to early autumn, and winter weather will move to early spring, in Melbourne CBD.},

However, urban areas are only beginning to be represented explicitly in the land-surface schemes of dynamical climate models through modified energy and moisture budgets. This paper summarises recent evidence of urban impacts on climate and vice versa. The technique of statistical downscaling is then introduced through exemplar studies of London's future urban heat island and peak ozone concentrations. Projections of both indices are derived from atmospheric variables supplied by four general circulation models, driven by a medium-high (A2) emissions scenario for the 2050s. The results show further intensification of the nocturnal heat island and higher ozone concentrations that are most pronounced in summer. These changes reflect sensitivity to variations in regional climate alone, so omit other factors such as changes in land use, emissions, climate feedbacks, or synergies between air quality and heat islands. Nonetheless, the downscaled scenarios are consistent with an emerging picture of increasing risks to human health in urban areas unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken.},

  abstract  = {In the modern era of urban climatology, much emphasis has been placed on observing and documenting heat island magnitudes in cities around the world. Urban climate literature consequently boasts a remarkable accumulation of observational heat island studies. Through time, however, methodologists have raised concerns about the authenticity of these studies, especially regarding the measurement, definition and reporting of heat island magnitudes. This paper substantiates these concerns through a systematic review and scientific critique of heat island literature from the period 1950–2007. The review uses nine criteria of experimental design and communication to critically assess methodological quality in a sample of 190 heat island studies. Results of this assessment are discouraging: the mean quality score of the sample is just 50 percent, and nearly half of all urban heat island magnitudes reported in the sample are judged to be scientifically indefensible. Two areas of universal weakness in the literature sample are controlled measurement and openness of method: one-half of the sample studies fail to sufficiently control the confounding effects of weather, relief or time on reported ‘urban’ heat island magnitudes, and three-quarters fail to communicate basic metadata regarding instrumentation and field site characteristics. A large proportion of observational heat island literature is therefore compromised by poor scientific practice. This paper concludes with recommendations for improving method and communication in heat island studies through better scrutiny of findings and more rigorous reporting of primary research.

The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) indicator depicting 3D building distribution was introduced and integrated with the classic indicators. Their impacts on UHI were measured by ensemble learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model. Taking Wuhan as the study area, the eighteen 2D/3D urban morphology indicators affecting UHI in different locations and UFZs were extensively examined and compared. The results reveal that: 1) The impact of 2D/3D urban morphology indicators on UHI significantly varies across different UFZs, with dominance in transportation zones exhibiting opposite polarity compared to the other types; 2) positive impacts have a decreasing trend from the urban center to the edge, while negative impacts exhibit opposite trend; 3) XGBoost outperforms other classic methods in interpreting the impact of urban morphology on UHI for all UFZ types. The findings improving knowledge of UHI across UFZs will provide a practical guide for urban planning.},

  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {Many cities of the world suffer from air pollution because of poor planning and design and heavy traffic in rapidly expanding urban environments. These conditions are exacerbated due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. While there have been studies linking the built environment and air pollution with health, they have ignored the aggravating role of UHI. The past urban planning literature in this field has also ignored the science of materials, vehicles and air pollution, and technological solutions for reducing cumulative health impacts of air pollution and UHI. Air Pollution, built environment and human health are complex discussion factors that involve several different fields. The built environment is linked with human health through opportunities of physical activity and air quality. Recent planning literature focuses on creating compact and walkable urban areas dotted with green infrastructure to promote physical activity and to reduce vehicle emission-related air pollution. Reduced car use leading to reduced air pollution and UHI is implied in the literature. The literature from technology fields speaks to the issue of air pollution directly. Zero emission cars, green infrastructure and building materials that absorb air pollutants and reduce UHI fall within this category. This paper identifies main themes in the two streams of urban air pollution and UHI that impact human health and presents a systematic review of the academic papers, policy documents, reports and features in print media published in the last 10–20 years.},

We perform a statistical analysis of 21 years of ozone and temperature observations across the rural eastern U.S. The climate penalty factor is defined as the slope of the ozone/temperature relationship. For two precursor emission regimes, before and after 2002, the climate penalty factor was consistent across the distribution of ozone observations. Prior to 2002, ozone increased by an average of ∼3.2 ppbv/°C. After 2002, power plant NOx emissions were reduced by 43\%, ozone levels fell ∼10\%, and the climate penalty factor dropped to ∼2.2 ppbv/°C. NOx controls are effective for reducing photochemical smog and might lessen the severity of projected climate change penalties. Air quality models should be evaluated against these observations, and the climate penalty factor metric may be useful for evaluating the response of ozone to climate change.},

The scope and performance potential of sensors in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal sensing abilities have expanded far beyond the traditional boundaries of remote sensing, resulting in significantly better observation capabilities. First, platform developments are reviewed with the main focus on emerging new remote sensing satellite constellations and UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) platforms. Next, sensor georeferencing and supporting navigation infrastructure, an enabling technology for remote sensing, are discussed. Finally, we group sensors based on their spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics, and classify them by their platform deployment competencies. In addition, we identify current trends, including the convergence between the remote sensing and navigation field, and the emergence of cooperative sensing, and the potential of crowdsensing.},

  year     = {1968},
  abstract = {This paper seeks to examine the concept of the urban heat island as an example of the way in which the McGill programme is approaching the problem of studying the urban atmosphere. The emphasis is placed upon the need to study process, in an effort to provide a sounder physical basis for the urban heat island and other urban effects. URBAN HEAT ISLAND CONCEPT The term 'urban heat island' draws an analogy of the city appearing as a land mass in the sea of the surrounding countryside. The analogy is both climatic and geomorphic. Climatically the comparison is based on the contrasting heat responses of land/water, and city/rural surfaces. Hence Chandler (1961) likens the pulsating winds set up by the city/rural temperature gradient, to land and sea breezes. The geomorphic analogy is drawn upon by reference to the abrupt city/rural temperature gradient as a 'cliff' to the island, and the similarity of the heat island isotherms to topographic contours. However, just as modern geomor-phologists are not content merely to map landforms, so climatologists should not be content merely to describe the form of urban heat islands. Both the geomorphologist and the climatologist must involve themselves in the study of process. The study of process begins with an under-standing of the controlling factors. FACTORS CONTROLLING URBAN CLIMATE There are five classes of factors which, being unique to the city, control the urban climate and hence the urban heat island. (a) Urban fabric. The vegetation, crops and soil of the countryside are replaced in the urban environment by bricks, concrete, steel, asphalt and glass. Thus the city is generally a drier, denser, less pervious and more rigid surface. Micro-climatically the surfaces could hardly be more dissimilar.},

In 35 evening surveys under varying weather conditions, a characteristic horizontal temperature pattern existed for each city. Temperatures increased from peripheral open lands to built-up center in direct proportion to structure density. Characteristics of the urban gradients have been analyzed in relation to city size and to meteorological parameters. Vertical temperature data showed that built-up areas frequently caused instability up to about 3 times roof height in otherwise stable air and that a “crossover” point sometimes existed above which the air over the urban center was cooler than that over surrounding country.},

  abstract   = {The emergence of high-resolution satellite data, such as WorldView-2, has opened the opportunity for urban land cover mapping at fine resolution. However, it is not straightforward to map detailed urban land cover and to detect urban deprived areas, such as informal settlements, in complex urban environments based merely on high-resolution spectral features. Thus, approaches integrating hierarchical segmentation and rule-based classification strategies can play a crucial role in producing high quality urban land cover maps. This study aims to evaluate the potential of WorldView-2 high-resolution multispectral and panchromatic imagery for detailed urban land cover classification in Kigali, Rwanda, a complex urban area characterized by a subtropical highland climate. A multi-stage object-based classification was performed using support vector machines (SVM) and a rule-based approach to derive 12 land cover classes with the input of WorldView-2 spectral bands, spectral indices, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture measures and a digital terrain model (DTM). In the initial classification, confusion existed among the informal settlements, the high- and low-density built-up areas, as well as between the upland and lowland agriculture. To improve the classification accuracy, a framework based on a geometric ruleset and two newly defined indices (urban density and greenness density indices) were developed. The novel framework resulted in an overall classification accuracy at 85.36\% with a kappa coefficient at 0.82. The confusion between high- and low-density built-up areas significantly decreased, while informal settlements were successfully extracted with the producer and user’s accuracies at 77\% and 90\% respectively. It was revealed that the integration of an object-based SVM classification of WorldView-2 feature sets and DTM with the geometric ruleset and urban density and greenness indices resulted in better class separability, thus higher classification accuracies in complex urban environments.},

  abstract = {An account of seven years of meteorological observations in the growing town of Columbia, Howard County, Maryland, in the Baltimore-Washington corridor is given. Information was collected from fixed stations and mobile surveys. In the interval from 1968 to 1975 the town grew from 200 to 20000 inhabitants, with building activity eliminating the original diversified rural microclimates. An unmistakable urban heat island has developed that is quite notable nocturnally when it maximally reaches 8° C in the densely built-up town center. The time series of the maximal heat island is linearly related to the logarithm of population figure. At midday on sunny days the IR surface temperatures are directly proportional to the per cent of area built-up. The radiation balance reflects the changes in the urbanized area. There is little heat loss from evapotranspiration but large heat transport into the surface (day) and out of the surface (night). No effect on precipitation is (as yet) discernible. Relative humidities are lower in the town area than in the rural district. Roughness has increased and wind speeds have been reduced. In all seasons, except summer, hours of turbulent wind have decreased. Run-off has become typically urban and air pollution has increased (presumably from motor vehicle traffic). All findings support earlier studies on town climate and reveal considerable detail on the progress of atmospheric modification in the urbanization process.},

  abstract = {Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning. In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92\% overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20\%, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level.},

In this article, the evaluation of the SUHI effect in the city of Madrid (Spain) from thermal infrared (TIR) remote-sensing data is presented. The data were obtained from the framework of the Dual-use European Security IR Experiment (DESIREX) campaign that was carried out during June and July 2008 in Madrid. The campaign combined the collection of airborne hyperspectral and in situ measurements. Thirty spectral and spatial high-resolution images were acquired with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) sensor in a 11, 21, and 4 h UTC scheme. The imagery was used to retrieve the SUHI effect by applying the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm. The results show a nocturnal SUHI effect with a highest value of 5 K. This maximum value agrees within 1 K with the highest value of the urban heat island (UHI) observed using air temperature data (AT). During the daytime, this situation is reversed and the city becomes a negative heat island.},

  abstract  = {In this article, we present empirical models for estimating daily mean air temperature (Ta) in the Hurd Peninsula of Livingston Island (Antarctica) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data and spatiotemporal variables. The models were obtained and validated using the daily mean Ta from three Spanish in situ meteorological stations (AEMET stations), Juan Carlos I (JCI), Johnsons Glacier (JG), and Hurd Glacier (HG), and three stations in our team’s monitoring sites, Incinerador (INC), Reina Sofía (SOF), and Collado Ramos (CR), as well as daytime and nighttime Terra-MODIS LST and Aqua-MODIS LST data between 2000 and 2016. Two types of multiple linear regression (MLR) models were obtained: models for each individual station (for JCI, INC, SOF, and CR—not for JG and HG due to a lack of data) and global models using all stations. In the study period, the JCI and INC stations were relocated, so we analyzed the data from both locations separately (JCI1 and JCI2; INC1 and INC2). In general, the best individual Ta models were obtained using daytime Terra LST data, the best results for CR being followed by JCI2, SOF, and INC2 (R2 = 0.5–0.7 and RSE = 2 °C). Model cross validation (CV) yielded results similar to those of the models (for the daytime Terra LST data: R2CV = 0.4–0.6, RMSECV = 2.5–2.7 °C, and bias = −0.1 to 0.1 °C). The best global Ta model was also obtained using daytime Terra LST data (R2 = 0.6 and RSE = 2 °C; in its validation: R2CV = 0.5, RMSECV = 3, and bias = −0.03), along with the significant (p {\textless} 0.05) variables: linear time (t) and two time harmonics (sine-cosine), distance to the coast (d), slope (s), curvature (c), and hour of LST observation (H). Ta and LST data were carefully corrected and filtered, respectively, prior to its analysis and comparison. The analysis of the Ta time series revealed different cooling/warming trends in the locations, indicating a complex climatic variability at a spatial scale in the Hurd Peninsula. The variation of Ta in each station was obtained by the Locally Weighted Regression (LOESS) method. LST data that was not “good quality” usually underestimated Ta and were filtered, which drastically reduced the LST data ({\textless}5\% of the studied days). Despite the shortage of “good” MODIS LST data in these cold environments, all months were represented in the final dataset, demonstrating that the MODIS LST data, through the models obtained in this article, are useful for estimating long-term trends in Ta and generating mean Ta maps at a global level (1 km2 spatial resolution) in the Hurd Peninsula of Livingston Island.},

  abstract = {Urban Heat Islands (UHIs), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes are critical environmental concerns that require continuous monitoring and assessment, especially in cities within arid and semi-arid (ASA) climates. Despite the abundance of research in tropical, Mediterranean, and cold climates, there is a significant knowledge gap for cities in the Middle East with ASA climates. This study aimed to examine the effects of LULC change, population, and wind speed on LST in the Mashhad Metropolis, a city with an ASA climate, over a 30-year period. The research underscores the importance of environmental monitoring and assessment in understanding and mitigating the impacts of urbanization and climate change. Our research combines spatial regression models, multi-scale and fine-scale analyses, seasonal and city outskirts considerations, and long-term change assessments. We used Landsat satellite imagery, a crucial tool for environmental monitoring, to identify LULC changes and their impact on LST at three scales. The relationships were analyzed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Spatial Error Model (SEM) regressions, demonstrating the value of these techniques in environmental assessment. Our findings highlight the role of environmental factors in shaping LST. A decrease in vegetation and instability of water bodies significantly increased LST over the study period. Bare lands and rocky terrains had the most substantial effect on LST. At the same time, built-up areas resulted in Urban Cooling Islands (UCIs) due to their lower temperatures compared to surrounding bare lands. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Dry Bare-Soil Index (DBSI) were the most effective indices impacting LST in ASA regions, and the 30×30 m² micro-scale provides more precise results in regression models, underscoring their importance in environmental monitoring. Our study provided a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between LULC changes and LST in an ASA environment, contributing significantly to the literature on environmental change in arid regions and the methodologies for monitoring such changes. Future research should aim to validate and expand additional LST-affecting factors and test our approach and findings in other ASA regions, considering the unique characteristics of these areas and the importance of tailored environmental monitoring and assessment approaches.},

  abstract = {High spatial and spectral resolution thermal infrared imagery (8.0–13.5μm) from the SEBASS airborne sensor was used to analyze and map tree canopy spectral features at the State Arboretum of Virginia, near Boyce, Virginia. Fifty tree species were analyzed and about half were directly identified with varying degrees of success on the basis of spectral matched filtering that utilized laboratory-measured leaf spectra as the target signatures. Spectral averages of pixels extracted from SEBASS emissivity data compared favorably with laboratory spectra of leaves collected from individual tree species. Best results were obtained from species having relatively strong spectral contrast, wide and flat leaves, closed planophile canopies, and/or large canopy areas. Tree species having small leaves or unfavorable leaf orientations showed spectral attenuation likely resulting from cavity blackbody effects. Increased spatial resolution and better image calibration and atmospheric correction might lead to further improvements in thermal infrared plant species identification.},

  abstract   = {Hitherto communication theory was based on two alternative methods of signal analysis. One is the description of the signal as a function of time; the other is Fourier analysis. Both are idealizations, as the first method operates with sharply defined instants of time, the second with infinite wave-trains of rigorously defined frequencies. But our everyday experiences—especially our auditory sensations—insist on a description in terms of both time and frequency. In the present paper this point of view is developed in quantitative language. Signals are represented in two dimensions, with time and frequency as co-ordinates. Such two-dimensional representations can be called “information diagrams,” as areas in them are proportional to the number of independent data which they can convey. This is a consequence of the fact that the frequency of a signal which is not of infinite duration can be defined only with a certain inaccuracy, which is inversely proportional to the duration, and vice versa. This “uncertainty relation” suggests a new method of description, intermediate between the two extremes of time analysis and spectral analysis. There are certain “elementary signals” which occupy the smallest possible area in the information diagram. They are harmonic oscillations modulated by a “probability pulse.” Each elementary signal can be considered as conveying exactly one datum, or one “quantum of information.” Any signal can be expanded in terms of these by a process which includes time analysis and Fourier analysis as extreme cases.These new methods of analysis, which involve some of the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory, are illustrated by application to some problems of transmission theory, such as direct generation of single sidebands, signals transmitted in minimum time through limited frequency channels, frequency modulation and time-division multiplex telephony.},

Completeness criteria for 2D Gabor image representations are important because of their increasing role in many computer vision applications and also in modeling biological vision, since recent neurophysiological evidence from the visual cortex of mammalian brains suggests that the filter response profiles of the main class of linearly-responding cortical neurons (called simple cells) are best modeled as a family of self-similar 2D Gabor wavelets. We therefore derive the conditions under which a set of continuous 2D Gabor wavelets will provide a complete representation of any image, and we also find self-similar wavelet parametrization which allow stable reconstruction by summation as though the wavelets formed an orthonormal basis. Approximating a "tight frame" generates redundancy which allows low-resolution neural responses to represent high-resolution images.},

  abstract  = {The amount of remote sensed imagery that has become available by far surpasses the possibility of manual analysis. One of the most important tasks in the analysis of remote sensed images is land use classification. This task can be recast as semantic classification of remote sensed images. In this paper we evaluate classifiers for semantic classification of aerial images. The evaluated classifiers are based on Gabor and Gist descriptors which have been long established in image classification tasks. We use support vector machines and propose a kernel well suited for using with Gabor descriptors. These simple classifiers achieve correct classification rate of about 90\% on two datasets. From these results follows that, in aerial image classification, simple classifiers give results comparable to more complex approaches, and the pursuit for more advanced solutions should continue having this in mind.},

Although it is an unsupervised learning to clustering in pattern recognition and machine learning, the k-means algorithm and its extensions are always influenced by initializations with a necessary number of clusters a priori. That is, the k-means algorithm is not exactly an unsupervised clustering method. In this paper, we construct an unsupervised learning schema for the k-means algorithm so that it is free of initializations without parameter selection and can also simultaneously find an optimal number of clusters. That is, we propose a novel unsupervised k-means (U-k-means) clustering algorithm with automatically finding an optimal number of clusters without giving any initialization and parameter selection. The computational complexity of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm is also analyzed. Comparisons between the proposed U-k-means and other existing methods are made. Experimental results and comparisons actually demonstrate these good aspects of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm.},

Monitoring the trend of forest restoration in North Korea has important reference significance for regional environmental management and ecological security. Thus, this study constructed and analyzed a time-series land use land cover (LULC) map to identify the LULC changes (LULCCs) over extensive periods across North Korea and understand the forest change trends. The analysis of LULC used Landsat multi-temporal image and Random Forest algorithm on Google Earth Engine(GEE) from 2001 to 2018 in North Korea. Through the LULCC detection technique and consideration of the cropland change relation with elevation, the forest change in North Korea for 2001–2018 was evaluated. We extended the existing sampling methodology and obtained a higher overall accuracy (98.2\% ± 1.6\%), with corresponding kappa coefficients (0.959 ± 0.037), and improved the classification accuracy in cropland and forest cover. Through the change detection and spatial analysis, our research shows that the forests in the southern and central regions of North Korea are undergoing restoration. The sampling method we extended in this study can effectively and reliably monitoring the change trend of North Korea forests. It also provides an important reference for the regional environmental management and ecological security in North Korea.},

This requires the establishment of a financial crisis early warning system that can be dynamically analyzed based on historical data information. To address this research objective, this study proposes a k-fold random forest algorithm combined with a time series analysis model as an early warning algorithm for corporate financial crises. The algorithm takes advantage of the ability of the time series analysis model to make short-term forecasts of historical data and uses the time series analysis model to make forecasts of newly constructed financial index data. The k-fold random forest is used to analyze the financial situation of the predicted financial data and achieve the purpose of dynamic financial crisis early warning. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the financial crisis early warning model based on the random forest algorithm and time series is 89\%, which indicates that the model is effective and feasible.},

A best-estimate of trend is derived through a Bayesian approach. Thus, maps of multi-model mean scenarios for annual mean temperature and precipitation rates for the 21st century are obtained. Positive trends are found in both temperature and precipitation over northern Europe.},

  abstract   = {Nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important species present in the environment, which results in alteration of the chemistry of atmosphere. On the global scale natural emissions of NMHCs and VOCs exceed anthropogenic emissions, although anthropogenic sources usually dominate within urban areas. Among the natural sources, vegetation is the dominant source. Oceanic and microbial production of these species is minimal as compared to other sources of input. Isoprene and terpenes are main species of NMHCs which are emitted from plants as a protective mechanism against temperature stress tolerance and protection from ravages of insects and pests. The major anthropogenic sources for NMHCs emissions are biomass burning and transportation. NMHCs play a significant role in ozone (O3) production in the presence of adequate concentration of oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere. The production of O3 is based on Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) of NMHCS and VOCs. The compound's MIR multiplied by molecular weight gives Relative Ozone Productivity (ROPi). To check the reliability of current methods of measuring the NMHCs the Nonmethane Hydrocarbon Inter-comparison Experiment (NMHICE) had been designed. The sample of known composition and unknown concentration of different hydrocarbons was supplied to different laboratories worldwide and less than 50\% laboratories correctly separated the unknown mixture. Atmospheric scientists throughout the world are evaluating current analytical methods being employed and are trying to correct the problems to ensure quality control in hydrocarbon analysis.},

  abstract = {The magnitudes, distributions, controlling processes and uncertainties associated with North American natural emissions of oxidant precursors are reviewed. Natural emissions are responsible for a major portion of the compounds, including non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), that determine tropospheric oxidant concentrations. Natural sources include soil microbes, vegetation, biomass burning, and lightning. These sources are strongly influenced by human activities that have led to significant changes in the magnitude and distribution of natural emissions in the past two centuries. The total NMVOC flux of about 84×1012g of carbon (Tg C) is comprised primarily of isoprene (35\%), 19 other terpenoid compounds (25\%) and 17 non-terpenoid compounds (40\%). Vegetation is predicted to contribute about 98\% of the total annual natural NMVOC emission. The estimated annual natural NO emission of 2.1×1012g of nitrogen (Tg N) from North America is primarily due to soils and lightning, while the estimated 10Tg C of CO arises from biomass burning and vegetation. Field measurements of ambient concentrations and above canopy fluxes have validated emission estimates for a few compounds from some important landscapes. The uncertainty associated with natural emission estimates ranges from less than 50\% for midday summer isoprene emission from some locations to about a factor of 10 for some compounds and landscapes.},

  abstract  = {This article performed a comprehensive review of the different state-of-the-art of roofing technologies and roofing materials and their impact on the urban heat island (UHI) and energy consumption of buildings. The building roofs are the main sources of undesirable heat for buildings, especially in warm climates. This paper discusses the use and application of white roofing material in emerging economies. The use of white roofing material is a suggestion because of its cooling, evaporative and efficiency characteristics compared to traditional black roofing materials. Many research studies have shown that the darker roofing surfaces that are prevalent in many urban areas actually can increase temperature by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius to the environment surrounding these urban areas. Additionally, improved temperature control and heat reflection also work to reduce the energy requirements for the interior spaces of the structures that have white roofing surfaces. The white or lighter colored roofs tend to reflect a part of the solar radiation that strikes the roof’s surface. Consequently, one might believe that white roofing material would be commonplace and especially so within emerging economies. Yet, this is hardly the case at all. This paper examines the issue of white roofing materials in emerging economies from a dual perspective. The dual perspective includes the technical details of white roofing material and its impact on lowering the interior temperature of the affected structures, which consequently reduces hours of indoor thermal discomfort and use of air conditioners in indoor spaces. The other element in this study, however, involves the marketing aspect of white roofing material. This includes its adoption, acceptance and cost-benefit in emerging economies.},

  abstract   = {The increase in the urban heat island is caused by the replacement of vegetation cover by impervious surfaces. As the population of Addis Ababa City has increased dramatically, the vegetation cover and other land cover classes have been converted into built-up areas. This study attempted to examine the relationship between urban heat islands and urban thermal comfort (UTCL) and land use and land cover (LULC) change using geospatial technologies in Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia. Landsat TM 1991, Landsat ETM + 2005, and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2021 data were used in this study. During the study period, LULC change, land surface temperature (LST), and urban heat island were calculated using the multispectral and thermal infrared bands (1991-2021). Results revealed that the built-up area in 1991 was 96.6 km2 (18.3\%), and increased to 165.4 km2 (31.4\%) and 277.2 km2 (52.6\%) by 2005 and 2021, respectively. In contrast, agriculture and vegetation land cover classes were declined by 66.8 km2 and 25.7 km2, respectively between 1991 and 2021. Rapid conversion of LULC change increases the mean LST of Addis Ababa City by 8.3 °C over the last three decades. According to the results, a high LST was recorded over built-up regions and areas with little vegetative cover. Furthermore, the central areas of the study area suffered a greater UHI effect than the surrounding areas. The results of the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) revealed that the UHI varies greatly across the city. Strong, stronger, and strongest urban heat islands dominated the central, southwestern, and southeastern suburbans of the study area, respectively. The excellent comfort level has declined from 16.3 km2 (3.1\%) in 1991 to 12.1 km2 (2.3\%) in 2021. The study proposed that local community awareness needs to be raised for environmental conservation through the establishment of urban green spaces that reduce UHI and increase comfort in Addis Ababa City.},

  abstract   = {Urban green infrastructure can to a certain extent mitigate urban warming. However, the cooling effect of plants varies with space, time and plant-specific properties. To contribute to our understanding of the cooling effect of vegetation on urban surface and air temperature, 21 parks in Addis Ababa were studied. Air temperature and humidity were measured for 60 plots in nine of the parks for 15 days. Furthermore, the thermal band of Landsat ETM+ was used to examine the cooling impact of all 21 parks on a larger spatial scale. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationship between characteristics of the vegetation and observed temperature. It emerged that Eucalyptus sp. had a significantly higher cooling effect than any other species group (P{\textless}0.05) and the species with the least effect on temperature were Grevillea and Cupressus. On a larger spatial scale, the cooling effect of parks on their surroundings (Park Cooling Intensity, PCI) was positively related to the NDVI and area of parks (P{\textless}0.01). A negative relationship was observed between PCI and park shape index (SI). The range within which the cooling effect could be observed (Park Cooling Distance, PCD) was positively related to SI and park area. The maximum PCI was 6.72°C and the maximum PCD was estimated at 240m. We conclude that the cooling effect is mainly determined by species group, canopy cover, size and shape of parks. Thus, the study provides insights regarding the importance of species choice and spatial design of green spaces in cooling the environment.},

One of the roles of CRES within the team was to describe simplified parameters for the use of vegetation in the urban context, which can eventually be used irrespective of site-specific characteristics for different climatic contexts and urban textures. Of particular interest is the effect of vegetation on microclimate: thermal effects, as well as the effect of vegetation on solar and daylight access. These affect the microclimate of the existing open spaces as well as the energy use of the surrounding buildings for heating, cooling and lighting, through shading, evapotranspiration, etc. Simple parametric studies were examined, to identify the thermal impact of vegetation in the urban environment, at the scale of the urban block, particularly as far as the reduction of air temperature is concerned.},

Five indicator sets are used to shed light on built-up areas, residential land use, land taken by urban expansion, population density and urban density. The built-up areas have grown considerably in all studied cities. The most rapid growth dates back to 1950s and 1960s. The annual growth pace has slowed down in the 1990s to 0.75\%. In half of the studied cities over 90\% of all new housing areas built after the mid-1950s are discontinuous urban developments. When putting these findings into the context of stable or decreasing urban population, it is clear that the structure of European cities has become less compact. In most cases it is mere a question of taste whether to call it urban sprawl or urban dispersion. Although most studied urban areas have experienced dispersed growth, as a result of the analysis we divide the cities in three groups: compact southern cities, northern and eastern cities with looser structures and lower densities mainly located in northern and eastern parts of Europe, and central and western cities in the midway between the extremes. However it has to be borne in mind that groupings are always to some extent artificial, forcing strict boundaries on phenomena which are continuous by nature.},

Although the concept of “Urban Interface” (UI) is discussed widely in the context of urban-rural and/or natural-artificial environment, UI has been used in the computer and communication disciplines, as well as in economy, geography, regional planning, city planning and architecture. UI has also been used in relation to electronic traffic control systems in urban transportation. UI between buildings and city is a relatively new issue in the literature. UI is defined with variant paradigms since the phenomenon is uncertain. This article reports on the use of fuzzy logic to create a kind of expert system for evaluating architectural elements in the context of UI. Fuzzy is the mathematical models of verbal expression on the area of specialization. This study is useful because this study shows a way to transform non-intuitive and precise concepts to the measurable and accurate results into a model. In order to create a model, the definition of UI in literature is evaluated and according to this evaluation a definition in terms of architecture is determined. The model of this new definition is created with using fuzzy logic using the Fuzzy Tec software. The predictions and experiences of a designer are represented in the model, which has been designed to behave like an expert person. Therefore, it has been shown that the definition of “expert system” can be added to architectural software. Lastly, a model that can give a fuzzy logic system for determining the quality of Urban Interface with sixteen parameters has been presented to the scientific field.},

Nonterrestrial planetary studies, conducted at fairly coarse resolution, have been useful primarily in determining the distribution of rock fragments. Terrestrial studies, conducted from satellite and aircraft at coarse to fine resolutions, have been successful for monitoring effusive volcanism, delineating areas of steaming altered ground and hot-spring activity, detecting fractures expressed hydrologically and topographically, and distinguishing a variety of geologic materials with physical and compositional differences. Interpretation of thermal images is complicated by the various types of physical processes involved and commonly requires an assessment of many different factors. A simple theoretical model was used in this analysis to provide quantitative assessment of some of these factors, to predict optimum times to acquire thermal data, and to determine quantitative values of various properties of terrian. Two geologic applications were studied in some detail: geothermal mapping and thermal inertia mapping. Initial results indicate that both techniques have considerable potential, especially in reconnaissance studies. These data were acquired under optimal meteorological conditions and at sites where the geologic materials were well exposed. A realistic assessment of the limitations of these techniques must await future studies.},

  abstract   = {Many cities of the world suffer from air pollution because of poor planning and design and heavy traffic in rapidly expanding urban environments. These conditions are exacerbated due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. While there have been studies linking the built environment and air pollution with health, they have ignored the aggravating role of UHI. The past urban planning literature in this field has also ignored the science of materials, vehicles and air pollution, and technological solutions for reducing cumulative health impacts of air pollution and UHI. Air Pollution, built environment and human health are complex discussion factors that involve several different fields. The built environment is linked with human health through opportunities of physical activity and air quality. Recent planning literature focuses on creating compact and walkable urban areas dotted with green infrastructure to promote physical activity and to reduce vehicle emission-related air pollution. Reduced car use leading to reduced air pollution and UHI is implied in the literature. The literature from technology fields speaks to the issue of air pollution directly. Zero emission cars, green infrastructure and building materials that absorb air pollutants and reduce UHI fall within this category. This paper identifies main themes in the two streams of urban air pollution and UHI that impact human health and presents a systematic review of the academic papers, policy documents, reports and features in print media published in the last 10–20 years.},

  abstract  = {Under the trend in climate change, global warming, and the increasingly serious urban heat island effect, promoting urban wind corridor planning to reduce urban temperature and mitigate the effect of urban heat islands has received widespread attention in many cities. With emerging awareness of the need to explicitly incorporate climate considerations into urban planning and design, integrating current spatial analysis and simulation tools to enhance urban wind corridor planning to obtain the best urban ventilation effect has become an increasingly important research topic in green city development. However, how to systematically carry out urban wind corridor planning by employing related technology and simulation tools is a topic that needs to be explored urgently in both theory and practice. Taking Zhumadian City in China as an example, this study proposes a method and planning approach that uses remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in an integrated way to understand urban landscape and to conduct urban wind corridor planning. The research results reveal that the urban form of Zhumadian City favors the development of urban wind corridors, and that the railway lines and some major roads in the city have the potential to be developed as the city\&rsquo;s main wind corridors. However, there are still ventilation barriers resulting from the existing land use model and building layout patterns that need to be adjusted. In terms of local-level analysis, the CFD simulation analysis also reveals that some common building layout patterns may result in environments with poor ventilation. Finally, based on the results of our empirical analysis and local planning environment, specific suggestions are provided on how to develop appropriate strategies for urban wind corridor planning and adjustments related to land use planning and building layout patterns in order to mitigate the impact of the urban heat island effect.},

The impact of the presence of vegetation in both places is evaluated and compared, further considering alternative scenarios for thermal comfort improvement. The thermal comfort condition is expressed in terms of indices (mean radiant temperature (MRT) and predicted mean vote (PMV)). Results show that at pedestrian level the presence of vegetation lead to an improvement of thermal comfort in summer of about 2 points in both neighborhoods. This improvement is also evident observing the spatial distribution of MRT with a difference of 7 °C in the Lecce neighborhood and 3 °C in Lahti. In winter, thermal discomfort is observed in the presence of vegetation with a difference of 1.3 °C in the Lecce neighborhood and 1.5 °C in Lahti in terms of MRT. However, trees and green cover have the important potential to offset climate change impact and to make urban environments less thermally stressful. This study aims to guide urban planners towards a motivated and necessary transaction towards new green infrastructure whose effect should, however, be analyzed and investigated case by case.},

  abstract   = {Ozone is a powerful oxidant and toxic air pollutant. As a gaseous pollutant, its primary target tissue is the lung and breathing slightly elevated concentrations of ozone results in a range of respiratory symptoms. These include decreased lung function and increased airway hyper-reactivity in 10–20\% of the healthy population. Moreover, those with conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) generally experience an exacerbation of their symptoms. Together, these observations suggest that certain individuals are particularly susceptible to this oxidant gas. The primary goal of this review is to examine the basis of this increased sensitivity. Ozone is a highly reactive gas that is consumed by reactive processes on reaching the first interface in the lung, the lung lining fluid compartment. Reactions between ozone and antioxidants tend to dominate in this compartment and these are generally thought of as beneficial, or protective interactions. In those instances when ozone reacts with other substrates in lung lining fluid such as protein or lipid, secondary oxidation products arise which transmit the toxic signals to the underlying pulmonary epithelium. The rules that govern the balance between beneficial and detrimental interactions in the lung lining fluid compartment are not well established but these may contribute, in part, to sensitivity. On reaching the lung surface, secondary oxidation products arising from ozone initiate a number of cellular responses. These include cytokine generation, adhesion molecule expression and tight junction modification. Together, these responses lead to the influx of inflammatory cells to the lung in the absence of a pathogenic challenge. Moreover, lung permeability is increased and oedema develops. The nature and extent of these responses are variable and often not related within an individual. Thus, although an improved appreciation of the general mechanism of action of ozone has been attained in recent years, the basis for individual susceptibility is still unclear.},

  abstract = {Due to the strong temperature dependence of surface ozone concentrations (O3), future warmer conditions may worsen ozone pollution levels despite continued efforts on emission controls of ozone precursors. Using long-term measurements of hourly O3 concentrations co-located with NOx concentrations in stations distributed throughout Germany, we assess changes in the climate penalty in summertime, defined as the slope of ozone-temperature relationship during the period 1999–2018. We find a stronger temperature sensitivity in the urban stations over the southwestern regions, especially in the first period of the study (1999–2008). We show a decrease in the climate penalty in most of stations during the second period of the study (2009–2018), with some exceptions (e.g. Berlin) where the climate penalty did not show significant changes. A key motivation of this study is to provide further insights into the impacts of NOx reductions in the O3-temperature relationship. For that, we propose a statisti-cal approach based on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to describe ozone production rates, inferred from hourly observations, as a function of NOx and temperature, among other variables relevant during the O3 production. The GAMs confirm lower O3 production rates during the second period (2009–2018) at most of the stations and a decreasing sensitivity to temperature. We observe that a large number of stations are transitioning to NOx-limited chemistry, consistent with a decreasing temperature dependence of O3 at moderate-high temperatures as a result of sustained NOx reductions. Moreover, the GAMs results showed changes in the shape of the function representing the O3-temperature relationship when comparing the first and second period, which suggest changes in VOC influencing the temperature dependence of O3. From these results, we infer effective VOC reductions over time that have also contributed to the observed decrease of O3 production rates. Thus, our analysis indicates that emissions reductions have been effective in a number of stations, particularly in the southwestern regions. However, we notice that in a few stations (e.g. Berlin) additional emission reductions should be required to effectively mitigate the temperature dependence of O3.},

Some implemented strategies may only be capable of dealing with a cluster of problems while leaving many others untouched. The co-benefits approach, however, opens up a ‘window of opportunity’ via achieving multi-goals simultaneously. Based on this, this paper aims to unpack the interrelationship between the struggling urban heat island (UHI) issue and the already ongoing sponge city (SPC) projects in China. Specifically, the co-benefits are investigated from technical, financial, institutional and social perspectives, after which pathways to implementation are presented. In these aspects, the co-benefits approach can bring opportunities for implementing SPC and UHI mitigation. The inclusion of UHI mitigation into SPC construction can enhance public participation and thereby consolidate the public-private partnership model for funds. During the co-benefits approach implementation, the weights of different authorities can be rebalanced to promote institutional transitions. SPC-derived UHI mitigation approach, potentially realising synergies of urban flooding and UHI mitigation, can be a model for countries which have already released low-impact development water management practices, and may also provide references for other projects such as green building, low-carbon eco-city, smart city, forest city and haze treatment for UHI mitigation.},

In this study, the relationship between LULC, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LST in Sivas city center and its surroundings was studied by using Landsat satellite images from 1989 to 2015 and UHI intensity was also demonstrated. The results clearly show that the urban built-up areas and agricultural lands increased while barren land decreased over the study period. The changes in LST can be monitored depending on the construction materials such as the presence of green areas, the city’s unique geographical location and topography. Urban built-up and bare lands have the highest LST and the urban built-up surface temperature showed a fluctuating trend while the rural area temperature showed a tendency to decrease. The urban built-up areas increased, a positive UHI intensity was observed and also an urban heat island formation was determined.},

Each method shows a very strong anthropogenic influence on the event over Europe. However, the magnitude of the RR strongly depends on the definition of the event and the method used. Across Europe, attribution over larger regions tended to give greater RR values. This highlights a major source of sensitivity in attribution statements and the need to define the event to analyze on a case-by-case basis.},

  abstract   = {It sounds straightforward. As the Earth warms due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global temperatures rise and so heatwaves become warmer as well. This means that a fixed temperature threshold is passed more often: the probability of extreme heat increases. However, land use changes, vegetation change, irrigation, air pollution, and other changes also drive local and regional trends in heatwaves. Sometimes they enhance heatwave intensity, but they can also counteract the effects of climate change, and in some regions, the mechanisms that impact on trends in heatwaves have not yet been fully identified. Climate models simulate heatwaves and the increased intensity and probability of extreme heat reasonably well on large scales. However, changes in annual daily maximum temperatures do not follow global warming over some regions, including the Eastern United States and parts of Asia, reflecting the influence of local drivers as well as natural variability. Also, temperature variability is unrealistic in many models, and can fail standard quality checks. Therefore, reliable attribution and projection of change in heatwaves remain a major scientific challenge in many regions, particularly where the moisture budget is not well simulated, and where land surface changes, changes in short-lived forcers, and soil moisture interactions are important.},

  abstract = {Background: 
          Epidemiologic studies show that high temperatures are related to mortality, but little is known about the exposure-response function and the lagged effect of heat. We report the associations between daily maximum apparent temperature and daily deaths during the warm season in 15 European cities.
          Methods: 
          The city-specific analyses were based on generalized estimating equations and the city-specific results were combined in a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. We specified distributed lag models in studying the delayed effect of exposure. Time-varying coefficient models were used to check the assumption of a constant heat effect over the warm season.
          Results: 
          The city-specific exposure-response functions have a V shape, with a change-point that varied among cities. The meta-analytic estimate of the threshold was 29.4°C for Mediterranean cities and 23.3°C for north-continental cities. The estimated overall change in all natural mortality associated with a 1°C increase in maximum apparent temperature above the city-specific threshold was 3.12\% (95\% credibility interval = 0.60\% to 5.72\%) in the Mediterranean region and 1.84\% (0.06\% to 3.64\%) in the north-continental region. Stronger associations were found between heat and mortality from respiratory diseases, and with mortality in the elderly.
          Conclusions: 
          There is an important mortality effect of heat across Europe. The effect is evident from June through August; it is limited to the first week following temperature excess, with evidence of mortality displacement. There is some suggestion of a higher effect of early season exposures. Acclimatization and individual susceptibility need further investigation as possible explanations for the observed heterogeneity among cities.},

  abstract = {Changes in temperature extreme events are expected as a result of anthropogenic climate change, but uncertainties exist in when and how these changes will be manifest regionally. This is especially the case over Europe due to different methodologies and definitions of temperature extreme events. An alternative approach is to examine changes in record-breaking temperatures. Datasets of observed temperature combined with ensembles of climate model simulations are used to assess the possible causes and significance of record-breaking temperature changes over the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. A simple detection methodology is first applied to evaluate the extent to which the effect of anthropogenic forcing can be detected in present-day observed and simulated changes in record-breaking temperature. We then study the projected evolution of record-breaking daily minimum and maximum temperatures over the twenty-first century in Europe with a climate model. The same detection approach is used to identify the time of emergence of the anthropogenic signal relative to a model-derived estimate of internal variability. From the 1980s onwards, a change in the evolution of cold and warm records is observed and simulated, but it still remains in the range of internal variability until the end of the twentieth century. Minimum and maximum record-breaking temperatures tend to occur (respectively) less and more often than during the 1960s and 1970s taken as representative of a stationary climate. Model simulations with natural forcing only fail to reproduce the observed changes after the 1980s while the latter are compatible with simulations constrained by anthropogenic forcings. The deviation from the characteristic behavior of a stationary climate record-wise initiated in the 1980s is projected to accentuate during the twenty-first century. Annual changes become inconsistent with the model-derived internal variability between the 2020s and 2030s. Over the last three decades of the twenty-first century and under the RCP8.5 scenario, warm records occur on average five times more often than initially. Conversely, breaking new cold record become extremely difficult. The Mediterranean region is particularly affected in summer, whereas central and northeastern Europe is more impacted in winter.},

  abstract   = {The London smog of 1952 is one of history's most important air pollution episodes in terms of its impact on science, public perception of air pollution, and government regulation. The association between health and air pollution during the episode was evident as a strong rise in air pollution levels was immediately followed by sharp increases in mortality and morbidity. However, mortality in the months after the smog was also elevated above normal levels. An initial government report proposed the hypothesis that influenza was responsible for high mortality during these months. Estimates of the number of influenza deaths were generated using multiple methods, indicating that only a fraction of the deaths in the months after the smog could be attributable to influenza. Sensitivity analysis reveals that only an extremely severe influenza epidemic could account for the majority of the excess deaths for this time period. Such an epidemic would be on the order of twice the case-fatality rate and quadruple the incidence observed in a general medical practice during the winter of 1953. These results underscore the need for diligence regarding extremely high air pollution that still exists in many parts of the world.},

  abstract = {Fine spatial resolution (i.e., ≤ 100 m) land surface temperature (LST) data are crucial to study heterogeneous landscapes (e.g., agricultural and urban). Some well-known spatiotemporal fusion methods like the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and the Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM), which were originally developed to fuse surface reflectance data, may not be suitable for direct application in LST studies due to the high sub-diurnal dynamics of LST. Furthermore, the effectiveness of spatiotemporal fusion methods for LST data has not been thoroughly evaluated in previous studies that only focused on relatively small spatiotemporal extents. To address these limitations, we proposed a variant of ESTARFM, referred to as the unbiased ESTARFM (ubESTARFM), specifically designed to accommodate the high temporal dynamics of LST to generate fine-resolution LST estimates. We evaluated ubESTARFM and ESTARFM against in-situ LST and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST across 12 regions throughout Australia, encompassing various land covers and environments. Independent validation showed that ubESTARFM had a bias of 2.55 K, unbiased root mean squared error (ubRMSE) of 2.57 K, and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 against the in-situ LST over 11,290 observations at the 12 sites, all of which were considerably better than those calculated for ESTARFM, being a bias of 4.73 K, ubRMSE of 3.80 K and R of 0.92. When compared to ECOSTRESS data, ubESTARFM LST had a bias of −1.69 K, ubRMSE of 2.00 K, and R of 0.70 over 43 near clear-sky scenes, while ESTARFM LST had a bias of 1.79 K, ubRMSE of 2.68 K, and R of 0.59. Overall, our results demonstrated that ubESTARFM can avoid systematic bias accumulation, substantially reduce uncertainty deviation, and maintain a good level of correlation with validation datasets when compared to ESTARFM. A further assessment underscored the potential of ubESTARFM for application using LST data acquired from geostationary platforms (e.g., Himawari-8), with a mean ubRMSE (R) of 2.22 K (0.97) against in-situ LST over 1327 observations at 3 sites from southeast Australia at the overpass time of MODIS/Terra. This promising method leverages reliable numeric values from coarse-resolution LST while borrowing spatial heterogeneity from fine-resolution LST and has the potential to be coupled with energy balance and/or radiative transfer models thus enabling better farm and/or regional-scale water management strategies to be implemented. Furthermore, both the input and generated LST data, encompassing a comprehensive spatial extent over diverse land covers and climatic conditions, are publicly available for benchmarking future algorithmic refinements.},

Globally, 1.05 (95\% Confidence Interval: 0.74–1.36) million deaths were avoidable in 2017 by eliminating fossil-fuel combustion (27.3\% of the total PM2.5 burden), with coal contributing to over half. Other dominant global sources included residential (0.74 [0.52–0.95] million deaths; 19.2\%), industrial (0.45 [0.32–0.58] million deaths; 11.7\%), and energy (0.39 [0.28–0.51] million deaths; 10.2\%) sectors.

  abstract   = {The heat index, or apparent temperature, was never defined for extreme heat and humidity, leading to the widespread adoption of a polynomial extrapolation designed by the United States National Weather Service. Recently, however, the heat index has been extended to all combinations of temperature and humidity, presenting an opportunity to reassess past heat waves. Here, three-hourly temperature and humidity are used to evaluate the extended heat index over the contiguous United States during the years 1984–2020. It is found that the 99.9th percentile of the daily maximum heat index is highest over the Midwest. Identifying and ranking heat waves by the spatially integrated exceedance of that percentile, the Midwest once again stands out as home to the most extreme heat waves, including the top-ranked July 2011 and July 1995 heat waves. The extended heat index can also be used to evaluate the physiological stress induced by heat and humidity. It is found that the most extreme Midwest heat waves tax the cardiovascular system with a skin blood flow that is elevated severalfold, approaching the physiological limit. These effects are not captured by the National Weather Service’s polynomial extrapolation, which also underestimates the heat index by as much as 10 ∘C (20 ∘F) during severe heat waves.},

  abstract   = {Thermal comfort is an important determinant of quality of life and economic vitality in cities. Strategies to improve thermal comfort may become a more critical part of urban sustainability efforts with projections of continued urban growth and climate change. A case study was performed in the hot, dry summertime climate of Tempe, Arizona to quantify the influence of evaporative misters on the thermal environment in outdoor restaurants and to understand business managers’ motivations to use misters. Microclimate measurements (air temperature (Ta), wind speed, relative humidity, globe temperature) were taken at five restaurants midday within four exposures: misted sun, misted shade, sun only, and shade only. We assessed Ta, mean radiant temperature (MRT), universal thermal climate index (UTCI), and physiological equivalent temperature (PET) between these four conditions within each location. Misters improved thermal comfort across all days, sites, and exposure conditions. MRT was on average 7.6 °C lower in misted locations, which significantly lowered average PET (– 6.5 °C) and UTCI (– 4.4 °C) (p {\textless} 0.05). Thermal comfort was most improved using mist in combination with shade. Under such conditions, PET and UTCI were reduced by 15.5 °C and 9.7 °C (p {\textless} 0.05), respectively. Business managers identified customer comfort and increased seating capacity as the principal factors for mister use. Esthetics of misters further encouraged use, while cost and environmental concerns were perceived to be less important. While this case study demonstrates value in outdoor misting in a hot, dry climate, additional work is needed to more fully evaluate tradeoffs between cost, water use, and comfort with continuing urban growth.},

Methods of fuzzy k-means have been used by other workers to overcome the problem of class overlap but their usefulness maybe reduced when data sets are large and when the data include artefacts introduced by the derivation of landform attributes from gridded digital elevation models.This paper presents ways to overcome these limitations using spatial sampling methods, statistical modelling of the derived stream topology, and fuzzy k-means using the Distance metric. Using data from Alberta, Canada, and the French pre-Alps it is shown how these methods may easily create meaningful, spatially coherent land form classes from high resolution gridded DEMs.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A simplified scale of apparent temperature, considering only dry-bulb temperature and humidity, has become known as the temperature–humidity index (THI). The index was empirically constructed and was presented in the form of a table. It is often useful to have a formula instead for use in interpolation or for programming calculators or computers. The National Weather Service uses a polynomial multiple regression formula, but it is in some ways unsatisfactory. A new model of the THI is presented that is much simpler—having only 3 parameters as compared with 16 for the NWS model. The new model also more closely fits the tabulated values and has the advantage that it allows extrapolation outside of the temperature range of the table. Temperature–humidity pairs above the effective range of the NWS model are occasionally encountered, and the ability to extrapolate into colder temperature ranges allows the new model to be more effectively contained as part of a more general apparent temperature index.},

  abstract = {This study presents numerical simulations analysing the effect of urban heat island (UHI) mitigation measures on the chemical composition of the urban atmosphere. The mesoscale chemical transport model WRF-Chem is used to investigate the impact of urban greening and highly reflective surfaces on the concentrations of primary (CO, NO) as well as secondary pollutants (O3) inside the urban canopy. In order to account for the sub-grid scale heterogeneity of urban areas, a multi-layer urban canopy model is coupled to WRF-Chem. Using this canopy model at its full extend requires the introduction of several urban land use classes in WRF-Chem. The urban area of Stuttgart serves as a test bed for the modelling of a case scenario of the 2003 European Heat Wave. The selected mitigation measures are able to reduce the urban temperature by about 1 K and the mean ozone concentration by 5–8\%. Model results however document also negative secondary effects on urban air quality, which are closely related to a decrease of vertical mixing in the urban boundary layer. An increase of primary pollutants NO and CO by 5–25\% can be observed. In addition, highly reflective surfaces can increase peak ozone concentration by up to 12\% due to a high intensity of reflected shortwave radiation accelerating photochemical reactions.},

Thermal comfort can be defined through environmental, individual, and subjective variables. The Olgyay bioclimatic chart is an outdoor thermal comfort analysis tool, connecting temperature with relative humidity. The application of this tool is still limited to hot humid climates only where minimal differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures exist. The novelty of this work is to propose adaptations to the Olgyay bioclimatic chart, taking into consideration different climatic classifications. In addition, urban plantation is examined for its influence on thermal comfort through the bioclimatic chart. The method adopted in this research consists of field measurements of the microclimatic variables in the examined places. In response, a new graphic model is proposed with a range of thermal comfort zone and analysis of the data obtained. The neighborhood of Humaitá in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is applied as a case study to validate the proposed approach. Insights into this work reveal that the urban plantation is contributing to the reduction of air temperature and the increase of relative air humidity; however, this contribution is insufficient to reach the thermal comfort conditions.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, a major part of the stored surface water resources is wasted by evaporation. By implementing low-cost methods to prevent water evaporation, it is possible to return this part of water to the agricultural, industrial, and drinking cycles. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of polystyrene (compressed foam), pieces of wood, and synthetic beeswax cover with different surface coverage of 60\%, 70\%, and 80\% in the standard Colorado Sunken evaporation pan on the evaporation rate. The materials used in this research are accessible, natural, and affordable in terms of practical applications. Then, the parameters of minimum and maximum temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, sunny hours, pressure, and wind speed were obtained from Semnan Synoptic Station near the test site. Due to limited studies in simulation of evaporation reduction through intelligent methods, the evaporation values of polystyrene, pieces of wood, and synthetic beeswax covers were simulated and estimated by using artificial intelligence methods of M5 model tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Least-Square Support Vector Machine. Results indicated that compressed foam, pieces of wood, and synthetic beeswax covers, each with 60\%, 70\%, and 80\% coverage could reduce the evaporation rate by 43\%, 54\%, and 65\%, 10\%, 19\%, and 26\%, and 8\%, 18\%, and 25\%, respectively. From a statistical point of view, the meteorological data received from Semnan Synoptic Station had significant correlations with evaporation rate from station pan, Colorado pan, and pans containing polystyrene, pieces of wood, and synthetic beeswax covers. The temperature and relative humidity parameters are factors affecting the evaporation rate in Semnan station. After evaluating the simulation accuracy based on the parameters of the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and determination coefficient (R2), the best estimation was obtained by the LSSVM method with R2= 99\%. From an economic viewpoint, the compressed polystyrene sheet and synthetic beeswax imposed \$1 and 8 cents per m2 in Iran. Moreover, the discarded pieces of wood that are used in the present study are inexpensive. Regarding the cost and performance of the material in reducing evaporation, it is recommended to use polystyrene material, followed by pieces of wood and beeswax.},

The strengths of machine learning include the capacity to handle data of high dimensionality and to map classes with very complex characteristics. Nevertheless, implementing a machine-learning classification is not straightforward, and the literature provides conflicting advice regarding many key issues. This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs. We illustrate these issues through applying machine-learning classification to two publically available remotely sensed data sets.},
