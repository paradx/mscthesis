  abstract  = {Kernel methods have long been established as effective techniques in the framework of machine learning and pattern recognition, and have now become the standard approach to many remote sensing applications. With algorithms that combine statistics and geometry, kernel methods have proven successful across many different domains related to the analysis of images of the Earth acquired from airborne and satellite sensors, including natural resource control, detection and monitoring of anthropic infrastructures (e.g. urban areas), agriculture inventorying, disaster prevention and damage assessment, and anomaly and target detection.   Presenting the theoretical foundations of kernel methods (KMs) relevant to the remote sensing domain, this book serves as a practical guide to the design and implementation of these methods. Five distinct parts present state-of-the-art research related to remote sensing based on the recent advances in kernel methods, analysing the related methodological and practical challenges:  Part I introduces the key concepts of machine learning for remote sensing, and the theoretical and practical foundations of kernel methods. Part II explores supervised image classification including Super Vector Machines (SVMs), kernel discriminant analysis, multi-temporal image classification, target detection with kernels, and Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) algorithms for anomaly detection. Part III looks at semi-supervised classification with transductive SVM approaches for hyperspectral image classification and kernel mean data classification. Part IV examines regression and model inversion, including the concept of a kernel unmixing algorithm for hyperspectral imagery, the theory and methods for quantitative remote sensing inverse problems with kernel-based equations, kernel-based BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function), and temperature retrieval KMs.  Part V deals with kernel-based feature extraction and provides a review of the principles of several multivariate analysis methods and their kernel extensions.  This book is aimed at engineers, scientists and researchers involved in remote sensing data processing, and also those working within machine learning and pattern recognition.},

  abstract   = {Many cities of the world suffer from air pollution because of poor planning and design and heavy traffic in rapidly expanding urban environments. These conditions are exacerbated due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. While there have been studies linking the built environment and air pollution with health, they have ignored the aggravating role of UHI. The past urban planning literature in this field has also ignored the science of materials, vehicles and air pollution, and technological solutions for reducing cumulative health impacts of air pollution and UHI. Air Pollution, built environment and human health are complex discussion factors that involve several different fields. The built environment is linked with human health through opportunities of physical activity and air quality. Recent planning literature focuses on creating compact and walkable urban areas dotted with green infrastructure to promote physical activity and to reduce vehicle emission-related air pollution. Reduced car use leading to reduced air pollution and UHI is implied in the literature. The literature from technology fields speaks to the issue of air pollution directly. Zero emission cars, green infrastructure and building materials that absorb air pollutants and reduce UHI fall within this category. This paper identifies main themes in the two streams of urban air pollution and UHI that impact human health and presents a systematic review of the academic papers, policy documents, reports and features in print media published in the last 10–20 years.},

Later, 8,047 subjects reenrolled in 2002 (SAPALDIA 2). The effects of individually assigned traffic exposures on reported respiratory symptoms were estimated, while controlling for socioeconomic and exposure- and health-related factors. The risk of attacks of breathlessness increased for all subjects by 13\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 3, 24) per 500-m increment in the length of main street segments within 200 m of the home and decreased in never smokers by 12\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 0, 22) per 100-m increment in distance from home to a main street. Living within 20 m of a main street increased the risks of regular phlegm by 15\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 0, 31) and wheezing with breathing problems by 34\\% (95\\% confidence interval: 0, 79) in never smokers. In 2002, the effects related to road distance were different from those in 1991, which could be due to changes in the traffic pollution mixture. These findings among a general population provide strong confirmation that living near busy streets leads to adverse respiratory health effects.}},

  abstract   = {NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was designed to support the quantification and monitoring of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Its Snapshot Area Map (SAM) and target mode measurements provide an innovative dataset for carbon studies on sub-city scales. Unlike any other current space-based instrument, OCO-3 has the ability to scan large contiguous areas of emission hot spots like cities, power plants, and volcanoes. These measurements result in dense, fine-scale spatial maps of column averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2). For the first time, we present and analyze XCO2 distributions over the Los Angeles megacity (LA) derived from OCO-3 SAM and target mode observations. Urban XCO2 enhancements range from 0 − 6 ppm (median enhancements ≃ 2 ppm) relative to a clean background and show excellent agreement with nearby ground-based TCCON measurements of XCO2. OCO-3's dense observations reveal intra-urban variations of XCO2 over the city that have never been observed from space before. The spatial variations are mainly driven by the complex fossil fuel emission patterns and meteorological conditions in the LA Basin and are in good agreement with those from co-located TROPOMI measurements of co-emitted NO2. Differences between measured and simulated XCO2 enhancements from two models (WRF-Chem and X-STILT) are typically below 1 ppm with larger differences for some sub regions. Both models capture the observed intra-urban XCO2 gradients. Further, OCO-3's multi-swath measurements capture about three times as much of the city emissions compared to single-swath overpasses. OCO-3's frequent target and SAM mode observations will pave the way to constrain urban emissions at finer, sub-city scales.},

  abstract = {An ensemble-based empirical regression algorithm is for the first time developed to retrieve total column water vapor from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) near-infrared (NIR) channels onboard the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) satellite. This retrieval method uses precipitable water vapor (PWV) data estimated from ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) data to build a regression model in which the reflectance ratio observed from MERSI NIR absorption channels and the corresponding GPS PWV data are the parameters. The MERSI Level 1b data, specifically the three water vapor absorption channels centered at 905 nm, 940 nm, and 980 nm are used to retrieve water vapor. PWV data observed from 256 ground-based GPS stations located in the western North America in 2016 are used as reference data for model development. Then, validation is performed with data obtained during 2017–2019 from both the western North America and Australia to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the new PWV results agree very well with ground-based PWV reference data. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for ensemble median PWV is 16.72\% {\textasciitilde} 36.74\% in western North America and is 15.47\% {\textasciitilde} 32.31\% in Australia. The RMSE is 4.635 mm {\textasciitilde} 8.156 mm in western North America and is 5.383 mm {\textasciitilde} 8.900 mm in Australia. The weighted mean value using three-channel ratio transmittance has the best retrieval accuracy, with RMSE of 4.635 mm in western North America and 5.383 mm in Australia. This new PWV algorithm can retrieve PWV from FY-3B data with a higher accuracy for different regions. Different from conventional algorithms, no pre-observed information of atmospheric parameters is required in this model.},

  abstract = {A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can produce high-resolution two-dimensional images of mapped areas. The SAR comprises a pulsed transmitter, an antenna, and a phase-coherent receiver. The SAR is borne by a constant velocity vehicle such as an aircraft or satellite, with the antenna beam axis oriented obliquely to the velocity vector. The image plane is defined by the velocity vector and antenna beam axis. The image orthogonal coordinates are range and cross range (azimuth). The amplitude and phase of the received signals are collected for the duration of an integration time after which the signal is processed. High range resolution is achieved by the use of wide bandwidth transmitted pulses. High azimuth resolution is achieved by focusing, with a signal processing technique, an extremely long antenna that is synthesized from the coherent phase history. The pulse repetition frequency of the SAR is constrained within bounds established by the geometry and signal ambiguity limits. SAR operation requires relative motion between radar and target. Nominal velocity values are assumed for signal processing and measurable deviations are used for error compensation. Residual uncertainties and high-order derivatives of the velocity which are difficult to compensate may cause image smearing, defocusing, and increased image sidelobes. The SAR transforms the ocean surface into numerous small cells, each with dimensions of range and azimuth resolution. An image of a cell can be produced provided the radar cross section of the cell is sufficiently large and the cell phase history is deterministic. Ocean waves evidently move sufficiently uniformly to produce SAR images which correlate well with optical photographs and visual observations. The relationship between SAR images and oceanic physical features is not completely understood, and more analyses and investigations are desired.},

Urban areas are the most vulnerable, and specifically, the road infrastructure. The accumulation of large volumes of water and sediments on road-stream intersections gets severe consequences for the road drainage structures. This study integrates the spatial and temporal soil moisture properties into the research about flood prediction methods by a case study of two areas in Sweden, Västra Götaland and Värmland, which was affected by severe flooding in August 2014. Soil moisture data are derived from remote-sensing techniques, with a focus on the soil moisture-specific satellites ASCAT and SMOS. Furthermore, several physical catchments descriptors (PCDs) are analyzed and the result shows that larger slopes and drainage density, in general, mean a higher risk of flooding. The precipitation is the same; however, it can be concluded that more precipitation in most cases gives higher soil moisture values. The lack, or the dimensioning, of road drainage structures seems to have a large impact on the flood risk as more sediment and water can be accumulated at the road-stream intersection. The results show that the method implementing soil moisture satellite data is promising for improving the reliability of flooding.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface temperature (LST)–vegetation relationship. This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, USA, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thermal, and moisture properties of the Earth's surface that determine LST.},

  abstract   = {With the doubling of urban population within the next two decades and the disproportionate growth of megacities, it is critical to explore the synergism between urban heat and pollution. In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Köppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a more salutogenic urban design.},

Since urban residents and infrastructure are known to be highly vulnerable to extreme heat, the goal of this paper is to understand the interaction between the synoptic-scale heat wave and the city-scale urban heat island (UHI) effects. The study also qualitatively analyzes the primary factors that contribute to UHIs by comparing their intensities in different cities with distinct geo-physical characteristics. Our results, generated by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model augmented with advanced urban surface parameterizations, confirm that the amplitude of UHI is related to the physical size of the city. However, the results suggest that cities of comparabale sizes might interact differently with heat waves: in New York City; Washington, DC; and Baltimore (but not in Philadelphia) the regular UHI was amplified more strongly during heat waves compared to smaller cities. The results also establish that the pattern of UHI in different cities, its variability, and its interaction with heat waves are inherently linked to dynamic factors.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Urban facets—the walls, roofs, and ground in built-up terrain—are often conceptualized as homogeneous surfaces, despite the obvious variability in the composition and material properties of the urban fabric at the subfacet scale. This study focuses on understanding the influence of this subfacet heterogeneity, and the associated influence of different material properties, on the urban surface energy budget. The Princeton Urban Canopy Model, which was developed with the ability to capture subfacet variability, is evaluated at sites of various building densities and then applied to simulate the energy exchanges of each subfacet with the atmosphere over a densely built site. The analyses show that, although all impervious built surfaces convert most of the incoming energy into sensible heat rather than latent heat, sensible heat fluxes from asphalt pavements and dark rooftops are 2 times as high as those from concrete surfaces and light-colored roofs. Another important characteristic of urban areas—the shift in the peak time of sensible heat flux in comparison with rural areas—is here shown to be mainly linked to concrete’s high heat storage capacity as well as to radiative trapping in the urban canyon. The results also illustrate that the vegetated pervious soil surfaces that dot the urban landscape play a dual role: during wet periods they redistribute much of the available energy into evaporative fluxes but when moisture stressed they behave more like an impervious surface. This role reversal, along with the direct evaporation of water stored over impervious surfaces, significantly reduces the overall Bowen ratio of the urban site after rain events.},

  abstract  = {Nocturnal atmospheric cooling rates were investigated in a medium sized town in Sweden. Rates were found to be very different, depending on the time of the evening/night, therefore the urban heat island (UHI) development was divided into three phases: a, differential cooling; b, transition; and c, stabilization. In phase a the UHI intensity increases by differential cooling between urban and rural areas. In phase b, after the urban heat island circulation (UHIC) starts, there is a drastic change in the rural cooling rate. The urban cooling rate is unchanged in the early evening, but about 2 h after the start of the UHIC there is a sudden increase of the cooling rate as the cool rural air reaches the city centre. The UHIC is therefore assumed to be an effective way of transporting sensible heat between the rural and urban areas. In phase c this coupling results in an equalization of the cooling rates at both the rural and the urban site from 1.5 K h−1 and 1.0 K h−1, respectively, to 0.5 K h−1. Once the UHIC is activated, the system is self-regulating since if one factor is changed some of the others have to change as well in order to preserve the balance. In phase c the advective flux is estimated to be −9±4 W m−2 and to give a central UHI potential cooling of −0.3 K h−1 of the. Copyright  1999 Royal Meteorological Society},

A station located in Laverton (less urbanised area), which is 17 km southwest of Melbourne CBD, was selected as the reference station for the computation of UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD. Using daily minimum/maximum temperatures at the two stations, nocturnal/diurnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD were computed for the period 1952–2010. It was found that in Melbourne CBD, nocturnal UHI intensities show a clear rising trend over the period 1952–2010 unlike the diurnal UHI intensities. For the analysis of nocturnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD, under changing climate, for each calendar month statistical models based on the gene expression programming (GEP) technique were developed for downscaling general-circulation model (GCM) outputs to monthly average minimum temperature at Melbourne CBD and Laverton. Using the outputs of HadCM3, GFDL2.0 and ECHAM5 pertaining to the A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario on the downscaling models, projections of monthly average minimum temperature were produced for the two stations over the period 2000–2099. In each season, at both stations, the ensemble average of monthly minimum temperature gradually increased over the period 2000–2099. The ensemble-average UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD projected into the future was higher for all seasons in comparison to that of period 1952–1971. Downscaling models based on the GEP technique were developed for each calendar month for projecting the number of very hot days in November–March and very cold days in May–September in Melbourne CBD. It was found that, in the future, summer weather will spread to early autumn, and winter weather will move to early spring, in Melbourne CBD.},

However, urban areas are only beginning to be represented explicitly in the land-surface schemes of dynamical climate models through modified energy and moisture budgets. This paper summarises recent evidence of urban impacts on climate and vice versa. The technique of statistical downscaling is then introduced through exemplar studies of London's future urban heat island and peak ozone concentrations. Projections of both indices are derived from atmospheric variables supplied by four general circulation models, driven by a medium-high (A2) emissions scenario for the 2050s. The results show further intensification of the nocturnal heat island and higher ozone concentrations that are most pronounced in summer. These changes reflect sensitivity to variations in regional climate alone, so omit other factors such as changes in land use, emissions, climate feedbacks, or synergies between air quality and heat islands. Nonetheless, the downscaled scenarios are consistent with an emerging picture of increasing risks to human health in urban areas unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken.},

  abstract = {In this paper, three methods to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from thermal infrared data supplied by band 6 of the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 satellite are compared. The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 22 (2001) 3719] and the single-channel algorithm developed by Jiménez-Muñoz and Sobrino [Journal of Geophysical Research 108 (2003)]. The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jiménez-Muñoz algorithm is used.},

The heat island grew most rapidly following sunset because of much stronger rural cooling. The maximum heat island occurred 3–5 h after sunset in both cities, and in both summer and winter. Rural cooling followed Brunt's formula, but the urban area showed a linear drop in temperature with time. Hence it was possible to assign a rural thermal admittance, but not an urban one. The results suggest that nocturnal energy exchange in the city is complex.},

  abstract  = {In the modern era of urban climatology, much emphasis has been placed on observing and documenting heat island magnitudes in cities around the world. Urban climate literature consequently boasts a remarkable accumulation of observational heat island studies. Through time, however, methodologists have raised concerns about the authenticity of these studies, especially regarding the measurement, definition and reporting of heat island magnitudes. This paper substantiates these concerns through a systematic review and scientific critique of heat island literature from the period 1950–2007. The review uses nine criteria of experimental design and communication to critically assess methodological quality in a sample of 190 heat island studies. Results of this assessment are discouraging: the mean quality score of the sample is just 50 percent, and nearly half of all urban heat island magnitudes reported in the sample are judged to be scientifically indefensible. Two areas of universal weakness in the literature sample are controlled measurement and openness of method: one-half of the sample studies fail to sufficiently control the confounding effects of weather, relief or time on reported ‘urban’ heat island magnitudes, and three-quarters fail to communicate basic metadata regarding instrumentation and field site characteristics. A large proportion of observational heat island literature is therefore compromised by poor scientific practice. This paper concludes with recommendations for improving method and communication in heat island studies through better scrutiny of findings and more rigorous reporting of primary research.

However, observations of air temperature are typically only available from a limited number of weather stations distributed mainly in developed countries, which in turn may often report time series with missing values. As a consequence, the record of air temperature observations is patchy in both space and time. Satellites, on the other hand, measure land surface temperature continuously in both space and time. In order to combine the relative strengths of surface and satellite temperature records, we develop a dataset in which monthly air temperature is predicted from monthly land surface temperature for the years 2003 to 2016, using a statistical model that incorporates information on geographic and climatic similarity. We expect this dataset to be useful for various applications involving climate monitoring and land-climate interactions.},

  abstract  = {Retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from satellite data allows to estimate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) as the difference between the LST obtained in the urban area and the LST of its surroundings. However, this definition depends on the selection of the urban and surroundings references, which translates into greater difficulty in comparing SUHI values in different urban agglomerations across the world. In order to avoid this problem, a methodology is proposed that allows reliable quantification of the SUHI. The urban reference is obtained from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover and three surroundings references are considered; that is, the urban adjacent (Su), the future adjacent (Sf), and the peri-urban (Sp), which are obtained from mathematical expressions that depend exclusively on the urban area. In addition, two formulations of SUHI are considered: SUHIMAX and SUHIMEAN, which evaluate the maximum and average SUHI of the urban area for each of the three surrounding references. As the urban population growth phenomenon is a world-scale problem, this methodology has been applied to 71 urban agglomerations around the world using LST data obtained from the sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) on board Sentinel-3A. The results show average values of SUHIMEAN of (1.8 ± 0.9) °C, (2.6 ± 1.3) °C, and (3.1 ± 1.7) °C for Su, Sf, and Sp, respectively, and an average difference between SUHIMAX and SUHIMEAN of (3.1 ± 1.1) °C. To complete the study, two additional indices have been considered: the Urban Thermal Field Variation Index (UFTVI) and the Discomfort Index (DI), which proved to be essential for understanding the SUHI phenomenon and its consequences on the quality of life of the inhabitants.},

This system is forced by meteorological conditions based on present-climate reanalyses (1970–2007), and climate projections (2071–2099) provided by global climate model simulations following two emission scenarios (A1B and A2). This study aims at quantifying the impact of climate change on air temperature within the city and in the surroundings. A systematic increase of 2-meter air temperature is found. In average according to the two scenarios, it reaches + 2.0/2.4°C in winter and + 3.5/5.0°C in summer for the minimum and maximum daily temperatures, respectively. During summer, the warming trend is more pronounced in the surrounding countryside than in Paris and suburbs due to the soil dryness. As a result, a substantial decrease of the strong urban heat islands is noted at nighttime, and numerous events with negative urban heat islands appear at daytime. Finally, a 30\% decrease of the heating degree days is quantified in winter between present and future climates. Inversely, the summertime cooling degree days significantly increase in future climate whereas they are negligible in present climate. However, in terms of accumulated degree days, the increase of the demand in cooling remains smaller than the decrease of the demand in heating.},

The existing procedures are subdivided into three main categories: Thermal indices, Empirical indices and indices based on Linear Equations; for each approach, case studies are presented and subdivided according to Koeppen Climatic Classification (Polar, Cold, Temperate, Arid and Tropical). International regulations and software available to quantify outdoor human comfort and microclimate are presented, as well as a graphic thermal scale to compare the ability of each procedure to respond to the 11-point thermal sensation scale (from Sweltering to Extremely Cold). Finally, the models are presented as function of their ability to analyse climate, microclimate and human-related characteristics of the selected built environment. This paper aims at bringing a comprehensive introduction to the topic of the outdoor human comfort, helping the reader to understand the existing procedures and guiding the choice of the suitable options according to specific research needs.},

There are 46 UHI risk indicators linked to three pillars of sustainability: social equity, economic viability, and environmental protection. In this study, the UHI risk indicators were first validated by experts to determine their relevancy and subsequently applied to randomly sampled dwellers of Thailand’s capital Bangkok. The UHI indicators were further validated with confirmatory factor analysis to determine the factor loadings (0–1) and reliability. Under the hazard component, the percentage of days when the daily minimum temperature is less than the 10th percentile exhibited the highest indicator-level factor loading (0.915). Vehicular traffic was the UHI exposure indicator with the highest factor loading (0.923), and the proportion of green space to build environment was the UHI sensitivity indicator with the highest factor loading (0.910). For the UHI adaptive capacity component, the highest factor loading (0.910) belonged to government policy and action. To effectively mitigate UHI impacts, greater emphasis should be placed on the indicators with highest factor loadings. Essentially, this research is the first to use statistical structural equation modeling to validate UHI indicators.},
