  abstract = {In this paper, three methods to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from thermal infrared data supplied by band 6 of the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 satellite are compared. The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 22 (2001) 3719] and the single-channel algorithm developed by Jiménez-Muñoz and Sobrino [Journal of Geophysical Research 108 (2003)]. The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jiménez-Muñoz algorithm is used.},

  abstract  = {As the global population becomes increasingly urbanised, so interest has grown in the potential climate change impacts on city infrastructure, services, and environmental quality. However, urban areas are only beginning to be represented explicitly in the land-surface schemes of dynamical climate models through modified energy and moisture budgets. This paper summarises recent evidence of urban impacts on climate and vice versa. The technique of statistical downscaling is then introduced through exemplar studies of London's future urban heat island and peak ozone concentrations. Projections of both indices are derived from atmospheric variables supplied by four general circulation models, driven by a medium-high (A2) emissions scenario for the 2050s. The results show further intensification of the nocturnal heat island and higher ozone concentrations that are most pronounced in summer. These changes reflect sensitivity to variations in regional climate alone, so omit other factors such as changes in land use, emissions, climate feedbacks, or synergies between air quality and heat islands. Nonetheless, the downscaled scenarios are consistent with an emerging picture of increasing risks to human health in urban areas unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken.},

A station located in Laverton (less urbanised area), which is 17 km southwest of Melbourne CBD, was selected as the reference station for the computation of UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD. Using daily minimum/maximum temperatures at the two stations, nocturnal/diurnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD were computed for the period 1952–2010. It was found that in Melbourne CBD, nocturnal UHI intensities show a clear rising trend over the period 1952–2010 unlike the diurnal UHI intensities. For the analysis of nocturnal UHI intensities in Melbourne CBD, under changing climate, for each calendar month statistical models based on the gene expression programming (GEP) technique were developed for downscaling general-circulation model (GCM) outputs to monthly average minimum temperature at Melbourne CBD and Laverton. Using the outputs of HadCM3, GFDL2.0 and ECHAM5 pertaining to the A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario on the downscaling models, projections of monthly average minimum temperature were produced for the two stations over the period 2000–2099. In each season, at both stations, the ensemble average of monthly minimum temperature gradually increased over the period 2000–2099. The ensemble-average UHI intensity in Melbourne CBD projected into the future was higher for all seasons in comparison to that of period 1952–1971. Downscaling models based on the GEP technique were developed for each calendar month for projecting the number of very hot days in November–March and very cold days in May–September in Melbourne CBD. It was found that, in the future, summer weather will spread to early autumn, and winter weather will move to early spring, in Melbourne CBD.},

For cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var DPI-70) and range grass (Eragrosticslehmanniana Nees) canopies, underlain with different soil backgrounds, the transformation nearly eliminated soil-induced variations in vegetation indices.

Since urban residents and infrastructure are known to be highly vulnerable to extreme heat, the goal of this paper is to understand the interaction between the synoptic-scale heat wave and the city-scale urban heat island (UHI) effects. The study also qualitatively analyzes the primary factors that contribute to UHIs by comparing their intensities in different cities with distinct geo-physical characteristics. Our results, generated by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model augmented with advanced urban surface parameterizations, confirm that the amplitude of UHI is related to the physical size of the city. However, the results suggest that cities of comparabale sizes might interact differently with heat waves: in New York City; Washington, DC; and Baltimore (but not in Philadelphia) the regular UHI was amplified more strongly during heat waves compared to smaller cities. The results also establish that the pattern of UHI in different cities, its variability, and its interaction with heat waves are inherently linked to dynamic factors.},

  abstract  = {Nocturnal atmospheric cooling rates were investigated in a medium sized town in Sweden. Rates were found to be very different, depending on the time of the evening/night, therefore the urban heat island (UHI) development was divided into three phases: a, differential cooling; b, transition; and c, stabilization. In phase a the UHI intensity increases by differential cooling between urban and rural areas. In phase b, after the urban heat island circulation (UHIC) starts, there is a drastic change in the rural cooling rate. The urban cooling rate is unchanged in the early evening, but about 2 h after the start of the UHIC there is a sudden increase of the cooling rate as the cool rural air reaches the city centre. The UHIC is therefore assumed to be an effective way of transporting sensible heat between the rural and urban areas. In phase c this coupling results in an equalization of the cooling rates at both the rural and the urban site from 1.5 K h−1 and 1.0 K h−1, respectively, to 0.5 K h−1. Once the UHIC is activated, the system is self-regulating since if one factor is changed some of the others have to change as well in order to preserve the balance. In phase c the advective flux is estimated to be −9±4 W m−2 and to give a central UHI potential cooling of −0.3 K h−1 of the. Copyright © 1999 Royal Meteorological Society},

This study focuses on understanding the influence of this subfacet heterogeneity, and the associated influence of different material properties, on the urban surface energy budget. The Princeton Urban Canopy Model, which was developed with the ability to capture subfacet variability, is evaluated at sites of various building densities and then applied to simulate the energy exchanges of each subfacet with the atmosphere over a densely built site. The analyses show that, although all impervious built surfaces convert most of the incoming energy into sensible heat rather than latent heat, sensible heat fluxes from asphalt pavements and dark rooftops are 2 times as high as those from concrete surfaces and light-colored roofs. Another important characteristic of urban areas—the shift in the peak time of sensible heat flux in comparison with rural areas—is here shown to be mainly linked to concrete’s high heat storage capacity as well as to radiative trapping in the urban canyon. The results also illustrate that the vegetated pervious soil surfaces that dot the urban landscape play a dual role: during wet periods they redistribute much of the available energy into evaporative fluxes but when moisture stressed they behave more like an impervious surface. This role reversal, along with the direct evaporation of water stored over impervious surfaces, significantly reduces the overall Bowen ratio of the urban site after rain events.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface temperature (LST)–vegetation relationship. This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, USA, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thermal, and moisture properties of the Earth's surface that determine LST.},
