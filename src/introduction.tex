Investigation on \glspl{UHI} using remote sensing data is a widely used technique to investigate surface temperature \glspl{UHI}. 
To investigate statistical relations between surface types, land surface temperature, air temperature and vegetation, remote sensing data of Landsat 7, 8 and 9 missions, weather station data and temperature models where used, to analyse the extend and behaviour of \glspl{UHI} in different locations and seasons.
