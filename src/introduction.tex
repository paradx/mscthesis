Investigation on \acfp{UHI} using remote sensing data is a widely used technique to investigate surface temperature \acp{UHI}. 
To investigate statistical relations between surface types, land surface temperature and vegetation, a software product was developed that processes multispectral remote sensing data of Landsat 7, 8 and 9 missions, to analyse the \acp{UHI}. 
This report is covering the theoretical background, development and function of the software, initial analysis on selected cities and an outlook how the software could be used for future analysis. 
This report covers the work done over the course of the summer semester as part of the Master Project module in cooperation with OHB Digital GmbH.
%It gives an overview about the used technology, the initial analysis performed on a few example cities and an outlook what this work might be used for in the future.
