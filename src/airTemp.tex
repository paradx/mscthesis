\subsection{Air Temperature}
Urban heat islands that impact human health are the atmospheric urban heat islands. 
These are defined by the air temperature of the urban area and the air temperature outside that area. %todo fix a bit 

During the day the air temperature is lower then the surface temperature\cite{epa}, during the night the hot surfaces radiate off the energy heating the surrounding air. 

There are multiple factors impacting urban air temperature. 
Combustion from traffic and industrial processes, produce heat as a by product that heats the surrounding air. 
HVAC systems also produce heat, when cooling buildings. This further increases the air temperature increasing cooling need within the urban area.
