\section{A historical introduction of urban heat island research}
  The scientific investigation of the urban climate and the influence of human settlements and activity on the local atmosphere and temperature has been studied for more then 200 years. 
  \cite{Howard1833} investigated the climate of London in a study from 1819 to 1827 and a similar study was conducted in Paris in the 1850s\cite{renou1862differences}. 
  The first mobile measurement campaigns\cite{peppler1929auto} and investigations of the spacial distribution of temperatures where conducted in the 1920s in Germany and Austria \cite{tollner1932untersuchungen}, and where repeated in multiple cities around the globe. %todo add more refs? 
  The term Urban Heat Island was coined in the 1960s in publications regarding case studies in London\cite{Chandler1961} and Montreal \cite{Oke1968}.
  During this time the influences and understanding of the interaction between the human industrial activity, the land change and the influence on temperatures was investigated by numerous case studies using fixed or mobile weather stations. 
  The first use of helicopters and airplanes to measure vertical temperature profiles where documented in the 1950s 
  %TODO add source 
  All these studies focused on the atmospheric heat distribution over urban areas and resulted in the development of physical energy transport models for these. 
  These models required a deeper understanding of the surface properties and the temperature distribution within the urban area. 
  % 
  Then newly available remote sensing devices such as infrared imagers made it possible to observe the urban environment from above and detect temperature hot spots using airborne and satellite images.  
  %  
  First investigations regarding the feasibility of this approach where proposed in the late 70s (\cite{Watson1975}, \cite{Carlson1977} and \cite{Block1978}) but the resolution of satellite images insufficient for detailed investigations of Urban Heat Islands.
  A first study using satellite infrared imagery where conducted in 1978 using the NOAA 5 Satellite (with a spacial resolution of 1km)\cite{Matson1978}. 
  Multiple studies in the 70s and 80s used images taken from planes or helicopters to aid the investigation of smaller scale effects within the urban surface temperature distribution (e.g. \cite{Landsberg1979}, \cite{ljungberg1980use} and \cite{Foster1981}).
  With advances in satellite technology the resolution and data availability increased. 
  The Landsat program stared in 1975 and since \textit{Landsat 4} was launched in 1982 the landsat program continuously provides thermal infrared data of the whole planet. 
  The increased resolution that allows pixel sizes between 60 m(Landsat 7) and 120 m (Landsat 4 and 5), allows investigation of smaller patterns within urban areas. 
  Increased revisit frequency of roughly two weeks made remote satellite data a more useful and widely used tool in the research of urban meteorology and urban heat islands.

\section{Theoretical Framework}
    \subsection{Definitions}
    \input{ndvi}
    \subsubsection{Wet Bulb Globe Temperature}
    The human body reacts to heat stress differently in different environmental conditions. 
    Working under heat stress poses a serious health issue, for this the \gls{WBGT} was defined as EN ISO 7243:2017, calculating the thermal load on the human body\cite{14001700}
    Heat exchange between the human body and the environment is dominated by evaporation of secreted sweat.
    The efficiency of this process is determined by the vapor pressure, that is influenced by temperature difference and the humidity difference. %TODO ref paper with caves
    The Heat Index is a simple way of calculating this efficiency that does not take radiant heat into account, the WBGT does incorporated this effect as well as clothing in this process. 

    \subsubsection{Urban Airquality}
    Large Urbanized Areas are suceptable to air pollution due to increased combustion and industrial activity. % TODO Numerous studies \cite{Kanakidou2011}
    One major pollutant with a significant health impact is tropospheric ozone (\cite{Ebi2008}). 
    Ozone is mainly produced when (antropogenic) NO\textsubscript{x} emmissions react with volatile organic compounds. %todo source
    The creation of ozone is dependent on temperature, increasing between 2.2 and 3.2 ppbv/°C depending on NO\textsubscript{x}

    \subsection{Models and Theories}


\section{Comparable Definition of Urban Heat Islands}
    \subsection{Introduction}
    The definitions of \glspl{UHI} in the literature are varying slightly and do not take into account that, using remote sensing techniques most definitions do not allow easy comparison between different areas or times.
    %TODO add sources, maybe add examples? 
    The definition of the U.S.~EPA\cite{EPA2008} and the German Weather Service (DWD) both say it is an feature defined by increased temperature between the urbanized areas compared to the sourrounding. % TODO cite  
    Different studies analyzing \glspl{UHI} use difference referenece tempereatures.
    The first goal of this work is defining a systematic reproducable aproach to measure urban heat island intensity based on land usage.

    \subsection{Approach}
    To make the approach comparable previous work was done takeling the problem using a comparable definition for comparing \gls{SUHI} around the world using Sentinel images\cite{Sobrino2020}.
    The land cover classes indicating urban areas is identified and the urban area polygon is extended by buffer zones. 
    \begin{figure}
      \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{img/UrbanAreaBremen}
      \caption{Urban Area of Bremen, with buffer zones for Adjacent and Peri Urban Area}
    \end{figure}
    In~\cite{Sobrino2020} urban adjacent, future urban adjacent and peri-urban areas are defined.
    The used approach was adapted by removing the urban growth projection (the paper investigated \glspl{SUHI} in 2050).
    For \gls{LULC} Landsat 8/9 data was used combined with a SVM (see \cref{sec:svm}). 
    \subsubsection{Used Satellites}
    Using remote sensing data to detect and analyse \gls{SUHI} requires devices that detect thermal infrared radiation. 
    Satellites that are equipt with thermal infrared sensors that are able to detect upwelling emmission from the surface temperature within the $ 8 < \lambda < 12 \mu m $ range
    \subsection{Analysis}
    \subsubsection{SVM}\label{sec:svm}
    For classifing surfaces a \gls{SVM} was used, that utilized multiple multispectral input images of the same city at different seasons as training material.
    The SVM uses a lagrange multiplication to optimize a minimiziation problem for a grouping a given set of multi-dimentional parameters. 
    In the case of the used multi spectral landsat dataset, the value of each image pixel for each band is used creating a vector of band 1--7 of the OLI instrument.
