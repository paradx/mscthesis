* Masterthesis Impact of Climate and Land Use Land Cover Change on Urban Heat
  Islands 

** Step 1: UHI Definition for Reproducibility 
1. Grab an Image from a Satellite 
2. Land Use Land Cover Classification using as much parameters as possible
(or external source?) 
3. Prepare LULC to binary and Watershed it 
4. Identify Urban core areas and sourrounding areas 
5. Calculate Mean Temperature of Sourrunding 
6. Calclulate UHIs based on that
